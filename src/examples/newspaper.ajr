0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1 0 1059 The authorities are warning of a
killer wolf on the loose. He has so 
far devoured an old grandmother and 
two pig brothers. He is described as 
being furry with big eyes and big
teeth.

On Monday this week he broke into
a house, and devoured an old lady. 
He then disguised himself as the old 
lady in order to deceive her 
granddaughter. Luckily for the little
girl a woodsman arrived in time to 
rescue her. Parents are being 
cautioned not to let their children 
wander about on their own, and to 
remind them not to talk to strangers.

The next day the wolf struck again, 
this time targeting two pig brothers 
who had most incautiously made their 
dwellings on the cheap using 
inadequate materials. The wolf also 
made an attempt on the third pig 
brother, but was unable to break
into his house.

Police are appealing to the public
for witnesses, and remind people to 
keep their doors securely fastened 
at all times.

``Always ask to see identification,'' 
said one police advisor,
``and invest in improving the 
general security of your property.''

0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1 0 507 An egg person tragically fell from a 
six foot wall yesterday afternoon 
and was smashed to pieces. The
king's cavalry rushed to the scene, 
but regretted that they were unable 
to help him.

Humpty Dumpty was believed to be 
sitting on the wall when he fell.
Police have ruled out foul play, but
are advising people not to play on 
high walls, particularly those 
vulnerable members of the population 
suffering from eggshell syndrome.
