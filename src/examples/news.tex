There was much celebration yesterday morning when Little Bo
Peep's sheep finally returned home. They had been missing
for more than a week.

``I just didn't know where to find them,'' the shepherdess
stated, ``but I was told to leave them alone and they'd come
home.'' 

Unusual advice perhaps, but it seems to have worked
as they did indeed come home. Eye witnesses reported that their
tails were wagging behind them.
``I'm just so happy they've come home,'' Little Bo Peep said
in a press conference yesterday afternoon.
The sheep themselves made no comment, and police are
still trying to determine what happened to them.
The big bad wolf is reportedly helping them with their inquiries.

This is a sample document illustrating the 
flowfram package. It uses \TeX's \verb|\parshape| command
to create irregularly shaped paragraphs. This can be a complicated
and somewhat tiresome task, but is made easier using FlowframTk.
The paragraph breaks in the static frames are actually
simulated breaks to ensure the \verb|\parshape| stays in effect
until the end of the frame. This is done behind the scenes by
the flowfram package, but is something that you need to be aware
of in case it causes a problem with other commands.
