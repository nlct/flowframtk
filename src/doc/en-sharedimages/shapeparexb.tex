This example has a circular shape and uses the \csfmt{shapepar}
command defined in the \styfmt{shapepar} package. The parameters 
were constructed from the path. Since this uses
\csfmt{shapepar} rather than \csfmt{parshape}, the shape will
expand or shrink to fit the text. The resulting paragraph will
therefore not necessarily be the same size as the original path.
