This example has an elliptical shape. The parameters were
constructed from the definition of the path, not the outline
defined by the line style of the path. The paragraph indentation
was suppressed at the start using \cmdname{noindent} to help keep
the desired shape. Again it needs to have just the right amount of
text to fill the entire shape, unlike paragraphs created using
\cmdname{shapepar} which expand or shrink to fit the shape.
