The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round
and round. The wheels on the bus go round and round all day long.
The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish, swish swish swish,
swish swish swish. The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish all
day long. The horn on the bus goes beep beep beep, beep beep beep,
beep beep beep. The horn on the bus goes beep beep beep all day 
long. The conductor on the bus says ``any more fares?'' ``any more
fares?'' ``any more fares?'' The conductor on the bus says
``any more fares?'' all day long. The mummies on the bus go
natter natter natter, natter natter natter, natter natter natter.
The mummies on the bus go natter natter natter all day long. The
children on the bus make too much noise, too much noise, too much
noise. The children on the bus make too much noise all day long.
The dogs on the bus go woof woof woof, woof woof woof, woof woof
woof. The dogs on the bus go woof woof woof all day long.
