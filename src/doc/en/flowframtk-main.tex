\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\FlowframTk\ (formerly \gls{JpgfDraw})
is a \gls{vectorgraphics} application written in \gls{Java}, with a 
\gls{gui}.  The main purpose of \FlowframTk\ is to generate \LaTeX\ packages or 
classes that use the \sty{flowfram} package, and to generate
\sty{pgf} picture drawing code. As a side-effect, it can also be
used to generate \gls{parshape} and (\sty{shapepar} package) \gls{shapepar} or 
\gls{Shapepar} specifications. In order to run the application you 
must have the \gls{jre} installed.

In \FlowframTk, you can:

\begin{itemize}
  \item construct shapes using line, move and cubic BÃ©zier segments
(\sectionref{sec:newobjects});

  \item edit paths by modifying the defining \glspl{controlpt}
  (\sectionref{sec:editpath});

  \item transforming paths with \glsxtrfull{cag} (\sectionref{sec:cag}).

  \item incorporate text (\sectionref{sec:newtext}) and 
  bitmap images (\sectionref{sec:insertbitmap})
  for annotating and background effects;

  \item combine text and a path to form a text-along-path
  effect (\sectionref{sec:textpath});

  \item apply replicas to a shape to form patterns
  (\sectionref{sec:patterns});

  \item extract the parameter's for \TeX's \gls{parshape} command and for 
  the \gls{shapepar} (or \gls{Shapepar}) command defined in the
  \sty{shapepar} package;

  \item construct frames for use with the \sty{flowfram} package
  (\sectionref{sec:flowframe}).
\end{itemize}

Pictures can be saved as (\sectionref{sec:saveimage}) or loaded
(\sectionref{sec:loadimage}) from \FlowframTk's native \gls{JDR}
(binary) or \gls{AJR} (ASCII) file formats. Additionally, images can be
exported (\sectionref{sec:exportimage}) as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a \LaTeX\ file containing a \env{pgfpicture} environment
    for inclusion in a \LaTeX\ document;

    \item a single-paged complete \LaTeX\ document containing the image
    (either just encapsulating the image or with the page set to the
    same size as the \gls{canvas});

    \item a \LaTeX\ package or class that loads the \sty{flowfram} package;

    \item a PNG file;

    \item a PostScript file;

    \item \pgls{svg} file.
\end{itemize}

Note that the export to PS/PDF/SVG functions use external
processes, such as \app{latex} and \app{dvips}.
\strong{You can't import back from the files you can export to.}

The low-level \sty{pgf} basic layer commands are used during
exports to \LaTeX\ files. These commands aren't particularly easy to
read but are faster to compile than the higher-level commands that
require extra processing to parse the syntax and perform additional
calculations. The primary purpose of \FlowframTk\ is to provide a
graphical interface that can generate complicated code that's hard
to write manually.

\FlowframTk\ was tested with version 3.0.0 of the \sty{pgf}
package, version 1.16 of the \sty{flowfram} package and version
2.2 of the \sty{shapepar} package. Files created by \FlowframTk\
may not work with earlier versions of those packages. Note that some
DVI viewers may not understand PGF specials. I strongly recommend
that you read the user manuals for those packages.


Notation: a \gls{primaryclick} is a single click with the
\gls{primary-mouse-button}. This is typically the left button for a
right-handed mouse (or left side of a trackpad), but may be the
right button for a left-handed mouse. A \gls{menuclick} is a click
with the \gls{context-menu} mouse button. This button depends on your
configuration, but is typically the right button for a right-handed
two-button mouse (and vice-versa for a left-handed two-button mouse). 
If the button isn't mentioned, a~\gls{click} can
be assumed to mean a~\gls{primaryclick}.

\chapter{Installation}
\label{sec:install}

Ensure that you have the \gls{jre} installed.
This can be downloaded from \url{http://java.sun.com/j2se/}.
You must ensure that you use at least Java~8, as \FlowframTk\
does not work with earlier versions.

To install, download the installer
\metafilefmt{flowframtk-}{appversion}{-installer.jar}
(where \meta{appversion} is the application version) and run it. 
This can be done from a terminal or command prompt using:

\begin{terminal}
java -jar flowframtk-\meta{appversion}-installer.jar
\end{terminal}

Depending on the setup of your operating system, you may also be
able to \gls{doubleclick} on the \ext{jar} file to run it.


\chapter{Accessibility}
\label{sec:access}

Most of \FlowframTk's mouse functions can be emulated using the
keyboard. Keyboard accelerators and
their menu mnemonic equivalents are listed in \tableref{tab:access}.

\begin{information}
Some functions will also try to move the pointer (such as
\menu{navigate.find}). This is done via the \emph{\gls{robot}}.
However note that some platforms or environments do not allow applications
to move the pointer, so keyboard functions that move the pointer are
not guaranteed to work on every system
\end{information}

Many of the accelerators may be changed using the \dialog{accelerators}
tab in the \dialog{configui} window (see
\sectionref{sec:configureuidialog}).  \accelerator{menubarfocus}
switches the focus to the menu bar. The return \keys{\keyref{return}}
key will usually be equivalent to the \widget{okay} button
except when the focus is with a component that interprets
\keys{\keyref{return}} for some other purpose (such as
a~\gls{dropdown}), in which case you need to use \accelerator{okay}.

Within editable text fields, you can use \keys{\keyref{ctrl}+A} to
select all the text, or shift \keys{\keyref{shift}} followed by
the left \keys{\keyref{left}} or right \keys{\keyref{right}} arrow
key to select a portion of the text. If some of the text has been
selected, you can use \keys{\keyref{ctrl}+C} or
\keys{\keyref{ctrl}+X} to copy or cut the text onto the clipboard,
and you can use \keys{\keyref{ctrl}+V} to paste text from the
clipboard into the text field.

\begin{warning}
Note that a few of the accelerators previously used by \gls{JpgfDraw} have
been changed in \FlowframTk, as they caused a conflict. For example,
\keys{\keyref{escape}} cancels a displayed menu, so if you use it to
dismiss a menu while you had a \gls{path} under construction, the
entire path could be discarded, which is undesirable. Therefore the
abandon path accelerator is now \accelerator{tools.abandon}. The
\accelerator{help.manual} key is now only for the main manual help
button. The help buttons in dialog windows and the preamble editor
are activated with \accelerator{help} and the help button in the
status bar is activated with \accelerator{contexthelp} (otherwise
the main help button, preamble editor help button and status bar
help button would conflict).
\end{warning}

\chapter{Settings}\label{sec:settings}

You can customise the appearance of \FlowframTk's main window either
using the command line arguments (\sectionref{sec:cmdargs}) or
using the settings menu (\sectionref{sec:settingsmenu}).

\section{Command Line Arguments}\label{sec:cmdargs}

\FlowframTk\ can be invoked from a command prompt. 

\appdef{flowframtk}

Depending on your installation, this command may run a bash script
(which will run the application \ext{jar} file) or this command may
be an executable form of the application \ext{jar} file.
The application \ext{jar} file is called \file{flowframtk.jar}
and may also be invoked from the command line explicitly:
\begin{terminal}
java -jar path/to/\file{flowframtk.jar}
\end{terminal}
where \filefmt{path/to/} is the path to the \file{flowframtk.jar}
file.

Note that the options and the filenames may be omitted.
Each filename must be either a \gls{JDR} or an \gls{AJR} file.
The \app{flowframtk} bash script uses the environment variable 
\inlineglsdef{JDR_JVMOPTS} to pass
options to the \gls{jvm}.  For example, if you want to run \FlowframTk\ with
a maximum size of 128Mb for the memory allocation pool, you can set
\gls{JDR_JVMOPTS} to \verb|-Xmx128m|:
\begin{terminal}
setenv \gls{JDR_JVMOPTS} -Xmx128m
\end{terminal}
The \app{flowframtk} script also uses the environment variable
\inlineglsdef{FLOWFRAMTK_OPTS} to pass options to \FlowframTk.

\begin{information}
If you have previously used \gls{JpgfDraw}, the \inlineglsdef{JPGFDRAW_OPTS} 
environment variable will also be recognised, but any settings in 
\gls{FLOWFRAMTK_OPTS} will override those in \gls{JPGFDRAW_OPTS}.
\end{information}

For example, if you always want \FlowframTk\ to start up with the grid showing,
 you can set \gls{FLOWFRAMTK_OPTS} to \switch{show_grid}:
\begin{terminal}
setenv \gls{FLOWFRAMTK_OPTS} \switch{show_grid}
\end{terminal}
(Bear in mind that \gls{JDR} and \gls{AJR} files can have certain
settings saved, which may override the startup settings.)

\begin{important}
Note that these environment variables only have an effect if you
use the \app{flowframtk} script to run the \gls{jre}.
\end{important}

Available command line options are listed below.
Older versions of \FlowframTk\ had switches prefixed with a single
hyphen (such as \shortargfmt{help}). These are still supported for
backward-compatibility but double-hyphen versions are now provided
(such as \longargfmt{help}).

\switchdef{show_grid}
Show the \gls{grid}.

\switchdef{noshow_grid}
Don't show the \gls{grid}.

\switchdef{lock_grid}
Lock the \gls{grid}.

\switchdef{nolock_grid}
Don't lock the \gls{grid}.

\switchdef{toolbar}
Show the \glspl{toolbar}.

\switchdef{notoolbar}
Don't show the \glspl{toolbar}.

\switchdef{statusbar}
Show the \gls{statusbar}.

\switchdef{nostatusbar}
Don't show the \gls{statusbar}.

\switchdef{ruler}
Show the \glspl{ruler}.

\switchdef{noruler}
Don't show the \glspl{ruler}.

\switchdef{paper}
Set the paper \gls{paper.size}. The argument may be a single keyword that
identifies a recognised paper \gls{paper.size} or, for a custom size, the
argument may be the keyword \optfmt{user} followed by the width and
height. For example:
\begin{terminal}
\app{flowframtk} \switch{paper} user 100mm 200mm
\end{terminal}

\section{The Settings Menu}\label{sec:settingsmenu}

\menudef{menu.settings}

While \FlowframTk\ is running, you can change the current settings
using the \menu{settings} menu. Most of the settings will be
remembered next time you use \FlowframTk, but may be overridden
either by \hyperref[sec:cmdargs]{command line arguments} or by
settings specified in any \gls{JDR} or \gls{AJR} file that you load.

If you have selected \widget{initsettings.default} in the
\widget{initsettings.title} tab of the \dialog{config} dialog,
then the \emph{\gls{canvas}} settings will be set to the default
values on startup (unless overridden, as above). Some (but not all)
of the user interface settings may still be remembered from the
previous session.

\subsection{Styles}\label{sec:setcurrentstyles}

\menudef{menu.settings.styles}

The \menu{settings.styles} menu item will open a dialog window
which can be used to set the current \gls{path} and
\gls{textarea} attributes. New paths and text areas will use these
attributes when they are created. The attributes for existing paths
and text areas are changed using the \menu{edit} menu.  These
settings are discussed in more detail in \sectionref{sec:styles}.

\subsection{Show Rulers}\label{sec:showrulers}

\menudef{menu.settings.rulers}

The \menu{settings.rulers} menu item can be used to toggle between showing
and hiding the \glspl{ruler} for the current \gls{canvas}. This
setting will be applied to new \glspl{canvas} that are subsequently
opened, but the setting may be overridden when a new image is
loaded.

\seealsorefs{sec:rulers}

\subsection{Grid}\label{sec:gridmenu}

\menudef{menu.settings.grid}

The \menu{settings.grid} submenu allows you to change
the \gls{grid} settings:

\menudef{menu.settings.grid.show}

The \menu{settings.grid.show} menu item toggles between displaying
the \gls{grid} on the \gls{canvas} and hiding it. If there is
enough memory available, the grid will be stored as a bitmap in
order to improve redraw speed.

\plabel[Locking the Grid]{mi:gridlock}
\menudef{menu.settings.grid.lock}

The \menu{settings.grid.lock} menu item toggles between locking and
unlocking the grid. If the grid is locked, mouse \glspl{click} will
be translated to the nearest tick mark.  This means that if you use
a mouse \gls{click} to set the location of a \gls{controlpt} when
constructing a \gls{path}, the point will be placed at the nearest
tick mark. This also means that when you move a point while in 
\editpathmode, the point will be moved in
intervals of the gap between tick marks. Note that locking the grid
does not affect the keyboard or menu driven functions, such as
\menutrail{menu.navigate.goto} \accelerator{menu.navigate.goto}
or emulate a \gls{primaryclick}
\accelerator{action.construct_click}.


When the grid is locked, the \gls{statusbar} will show the image
\includeimg[alt={Grid lock on}]{key} otherwise it will show
the image \includeimg[alt={Grid lock off}]{keycross}.
You can \gls{doubleclick} on this image to toggle the state.

\begin{warning}
If you lock the grid, you will be unable to use the
mouse to \select\ narrow \glspl{path} that lie between tick marks as
mouse \glspl{click} will be translated to the nearest tick mark, unless you
use the drag rectangle (which may \select\ other \glspl{object} as well).
\end{warning}

Similarly, if the \widget{editpathui.ignorelock}
option is off, you won't be able to select \glspl{controlpt} in
\editpathmode\ with the mouse unless a
tick mark lies inside the \gls{controlpt}['s] bounding box.
You will however be able to select them using the
\menutrail{menu.editpath.next_control} 
or \menutrail{menu.editpath.prev_control} functions.

\menudef{menu.settings.grid.settings}

The \menu{settings.grid.settings} menu item will open the
\dialog{grid} dialog box in which you can specify the position of the tick marks
and the units used. You can also open this dialog box by
\glslink{doubleclick}{double-clicking} on the top left corner
between the \glspl{ruler}, where the current grid unit is displayed.

\begin{important}
The grid unit is independent of the 
\hyperref[sec:controlsettings]{storage unit}.  However, it's a good idea to choose a
grid unit and storage unit that have a convenient conversion factor
between them. For example, \code{mm} storage unit and \code{cm}
grid unit. Regardless of the grid used, co-ordinates are always
stored as left-handed rectangular co-ordinates where the origin is
at the top left. This may cause slight rounding errors in the
conversion between rectangular and radial co-ordinates. If you are
using a radial grid and you change the paper size or orientation,
the grid origin will shift but the \glspl{object} will maintain
their original positions relative to the top left corner of the
\gls{canvas}.
\end{important}

\widgetdef{grid.title}

The default grid type is a left-handed rectangular grid. You can
switch to a different grid by selecting a different tab.

\FloatSubFigs*{fig:grid}
{
  {fig:grida}{\includeimg{grid-rect}}{},
  {fig:gridb}{\includeimg{grid-radial}}{},
  {fig:gridc}{\includeimg{grid-iso}}{}
}
[Available Regular Grids]
{Available regular grids:
\subfigref{fig:grida} rectangular grid;
\subfigref{fig:gridb} radial grid;
\subfigref{fig:gridc} isomorphic grid.}

\widgetdef{grid.rectangular}

The rectangular has the origin at the top left hand corner of the \gls{canvas}
(\figureref{fig:grida}). This has two parameters: \widget{grid.major}
(which identifies the grid unit) and \widget{grid.sub_divisions}
which indicates the number of minor tick marks between each major
tick.

\widgetdef{grid.radial}

The radial grid has the origin at the \manmsg{centre} of the
\gls{canvas} (\figureref{fig:gridb}). Bear in mind that any
radial co-ordinates will be converted to rectangular co-ordinates.
So the radial co-ordinate (0:0) will be converted to the rectangular
co-ordinate of the current paper \manmsg{centre}.
In addition to the \widget{grid.major} and
\widget{grid.sub_divisions} parameters, the radial grid also has 
the \widget{grid.spokes} parameter.

\widgetdef{grid.iso}

The isometric grid has the origin at the top left hand corner of the
\gls{canvas} where the major divisions indicate the length of each
side of the equilateral triangles forming the grid
(\figureref{fig:gridc}).

\widgetdef{grid.tschichold}

The \widget{grid.tschichold} is a typesetting grid after Tschichold
(see~\cite[p.~40]{Hoschuli}). This is the only grid that checks the
\hyperref[sec:displaypage]{display page setting}. If an even
numbered page is displayed, the \gls{verso} grid is shown
(\figureref{fig:tschicholda}), otherwise the \gls{recto} grid is
shown (see \figureref{fig:tschicholdb}). The \gls*{recto} grid is
used for the default \widget{displaypage.all} setting.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:tschichold}
{
  {fig:tschicholda}{\includeimg{tschichold-verso}}{},
  {fig:tschicholdb}{\includeimg{tschichold-recto}}{}
}
[Tschichold Grid]
{Tschichold grid:
\subfigref{fig:tschicholda} verso (even pages);
\subfigref{fig:tschicholdb} recto (odd pages).}

Note that you are limited to only fourteen locations with the
\widget{grid.tschichold} grid if you have the
\gridlock\ on. The settings for this grid style are the same as for
the rectangular grid and are only applied to the rulers. The origin
is the top left corner of the \gls{canvas} for both the \gls{recto}
and \gls{verso} displays. The grid settings (major and subdivisions)
are only applied to the rulers.

\widgetdef{grid.path}

The \widget{grid.path} grid follows a specified path. This places major tick
marks at the path's control points. (The major distance setting is
only applied to the rulers.) The subdivision setting will place
minor tick marks along the path segments.

\FloatSubFigs*{fig:pathgrid}
{
  {fig:pathgrida}{\includeimg{pathgrid1}}{},
  {fig:pathgridb}{\includeimg{pathgrid2}}{},
  {fig:pathgridc}{\includeimg{pathgrid3}}{}
}
 [Path-Based Grid]
 {Path-based grid:
\subfigref{fig:pathgrida} path used to form new grid
(current grid is rectangular);
\subfigref{fig:pathgridb} grid panel;
\subfigref{fig:pathgridc} path in
\subfigref{fig:pathgrida} has been deleted by the user and the new grid is now
visible.}

For example, in \figureref{fig:pathgrida} a circle has been
constructed on a rectangular grid. This circle will be used as the
guide for the path-based grid. Note that this will make a
\emph{copy} of the shape. If the original shape (the circle in this
case) is edited or deleted, the grid won't change.
In \figureref{fig:pathgridb}, the path-based grid panel has
been selected. This provides three options:

\widgetdef{grid.path.keep}

If a path-base grid has already been used, then the
\widget{grid.path.keep} option will be available and should be
selected if you want to keep that path.  This option will be
disabled if you haven't yet used a path-based grid.

\widgetdef{grid.path.usepage}

The \widget{grid.path.usepage} option will create a grid that
follows the page boundary. (That is, the path is the rectangle that
fits the \gls{canvas} border.)

\widgetdef{grid.path.select}

The \widget{grid.path.select} option allows you to select an
\gls{object} from the \gls{canvas} to use as the path.  If this
option is selected, the drop-down menu next to it will be enabled.
This lists all the objects in your image (as per the
\dialog{description} dialog box described in
\sectionref{sec:navigate}).

If the object is a \gls{shape}, that shape
will be converted to a complete \gls{path} (if not already a
\gls{path}), otherwise the grid will be based on the
\gls{object}['s] \gls{bbox}. In \figureref{fig:pathgridb},
the circle (Path:~4) has been selected.
(\hyperref[sec:objectdescription]{Assigning descriptions} to
\glspl{object} makes this task easier, but the drop-down menu will
default to the first selected \gls{object}, if applicable, to
assist selection.)

In \figureref{fig:pathgridc}, the new grid has been applied.  The
original circle has been manually deleted (using \menu{edit.cut}) to
allow the grid to be shown for illustrative purposes. Note that the
major division setting of 100\gls{pt} only applies to the rulers, as
the major tick marks are located at the shape's \glspl{controlpt}.



\subsection{Zoom}\label{sec:zoommenu}

\menudef{menu.settings.zoom}

The \menu{settings.zoom} sub-menu allows you to change
the magnification. You can choose one of the predefined
settings or you can specify an arbitrary setting.

\menudef{menu.settings.zoom.user}

The \menu{settings.zoom.user} menu item will open the
\inlineglsdef{zoom.title} dialog box (see \figureref{fig:zoom}) in
which to specify an arbitrary magnification.  The magnification
value may be entered as either a percentage
(\figureref{fig:zoompercent}) or a decimal value
(\figureref{fig:zoomdecimal}). For example, either 150\% or 1.5 to
zoom by a factor of 1.5.  You can also change the magnification
using the zoom function in the \gls{statusbar}. \Gls{click} on the
decrease button \includeimg{zoomdown} to reduce the magnification or
on the increase button \includeimg{zoomup} to increase the
magnification, according to the list of preset values.
Alternatively, you can \gls{doubleclick} to open the \dialog{zoom}
dialog box or \gls{menuclick} on the percentage value to open
a~popup menu.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:zoom}
 {
   {fig:zoompercent}{\includeimg{setMagnificationPercent}}{Percentage},
   {fig:zoomdecimal}{\includeimg{setMagnificationDecimal}}{Decimal}
 }
 {Setting Custom Magnification}

\subsection{Paper}\label{sec:papermenu}

\menudef{menu.settings.paper}

The \menu{settings.paper} sub-menu allows you to change
the \gls{paper} attributes.

\menudef{menu.settings.paper.margins}

The \menu{settings.paper.margins} item toggles between showing
and hiding the \glspl{printer-margin}, but note that this facility is not
available if you use the \switch{disable_print} command line
argument.

The predefined paper \glspl{paper.size} A0 to A5, letter, legal and executive
can be selected from the \menu{settings.paper} menu.

\menudef{menu.settings.paper.other}

The \menu{settings.paper.other} item allows a custom paper \gls{paper.size} to
be specified.  Select the  \widget{paper.predefined} radio button to
enable a list of additional known paper sizes or select the
\widget{paper.user} radio button to enter a custom size.


\subsection{Configure Image Settings}\label{sec:configuredialog}

\menudef{menu.settings.config}

The \menu{settings.config} menu item opens the \inlineglsdef{config.title}
dialog box, which can be used to change image settings.
(\sectionref{sec:texconfig} covers \TeX\slash\LaTeX\ related settings and
\sectionref{sec:configureuidialog} covers settings related to the user
interface.)


\subsubsection{Control Points}\label{sec:controlsettings}

\widgetdef{controls.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:configdialog-controlsettings}
  {\includeimg{configureDialog-controls}}
  {Configuration Dialog Box (Control Point Settings)}

The \widget{controls.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:configdialog-controlsettings})
allows you to:
\begin{itemize}
 \item set the size of the \glspl{controlpt};
 \item specify whether the \gls{controlpt} size should be affected by
the zoom setting;
 \item set the \gls{storageunit}.
\end{itemize}

It's best to set the \gls{storageunit} before you start creating an
image. If the selected \gls{canvas} isn't empty, all \glspl{object} will
have their co-ordinates recomputed in terms of the new unit, which
may take a while if there are many \glspl{object} or \glspl{path}
with many segments.  You can also open a dialog window with just the
storage unit panel in it by \glslink{doubleclick}{double-clicking}
the mouse on the storage unit area of the \gls{statusbar}.


\subsubsection{Startup Directory}\label{sec:startdir}

\widgetdef{startdir.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:configdialog-startdir}
  {\includeimg{configureDialog-startdir}}
  {Configuration Dialog Box (Startup Directory Settings)}

The \widget{startdir.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:configdialog-startdir})
allows you to choose which directory \FlowframTk\ should use as the
current working directory when it starts up. You have a choice of:
\begin{itemize}
\item the current working directory that you were in when you started
up \FlowframTk;
\item the directory you were using when you last used \FlowframTk;
\item a specific directory. In this case, type in the path in the
\widget{startdir.named} box or use the
\widget{startdir.browse} button to select the required
directory.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{JDR/AJR Settings}\label{sec:jdrsettings}

\widgetdef{jdr.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:configdialog-jdrsettings}
  {\includeimg{configureDialog-jdrsettings}}
  {Configuration Dialog Box (JDR/AJR Settings)}

You can use the \widget{jdr.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:configdialog-jdrsettings})
to specify whether or not you want the current
\gls{canvas} settings stored in the \gls{JDR} or \gls{AJR} file when
you save your image. You can also choose whether or not you want to
apply any canvas settings information stored in any \gls{JDR} or
\gls{AJR} file that you load. The canvas settings consist of:
grid show\slash hide, grid locked\slash not locked, rulers
displayed\slash not displayed, the tool in use, the LaTeX normal
size, the \gls{paper} attributes, the grid style, the size of the
\glspl{controlpt} and whether they should be affected by the
magnification setting.


\subsubsection{Startup Settings}\label{sec:initsettings}

\widgetdef{initsettings.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:configdialog-initsettings}
  {\includeimg{configureDialog-initsettings}}
  {Configuration Dialog Box (Startup Settings)}

You can use the \widget{initsettings.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:configdialog-initsettings})
to choose whether you want \FlowframTk\ to start with its
default settings, or whether to restore the settings from the last
time you used \FlowframTk, or whether to use the settings that are
currently in use.

If you choose the default settings option, the \emph{\gls{canvas}}
settings will be set to the default on startup.  Some (but not all)
of the user interface settings may still be remembered from the
previous session, including the language used by the user interface
and the manual, the paths to the required applications used by the
\filefn{export} functions and the button styles.

Most of the settings are saved in the file \file{flowframtk.conf} in the
\gls{config_dir}.  Mappings,
accelerators, language settings and the recent file list aren't
governed by the startup setting and are stored in separate files in
the configuration directory. When you upgrade to a new version of
\FlowframTk, the accelerators are reset to the default and then the
existing accelerators file is loaded to ensure any new accelerators
are added. Don't modify these files whilst \FlowframTk\ is running.
You may modify them after you have quit \FlowframTk\ using a text
editor, but make sure you save your changes before restarting
\FlowframTk.


\subsubsection{Bitmaps}\label{sec:bitmapconfig}

\widgetdef{bitmapconfig.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:configdialog-bitmap}
  {\includeimg{configureDialog-bitmap}}
  {Configuration Dialog Box (Bitmap Settings)}

You can use the \widget{bitmapconfig.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:configdialog-bitmap})
to choose whether included \glspl{bitmap} should be
saved using their full path name or a path name relative to the
file being saved. Relative names allow for greater portability, but
if you move the saved file to a different location, you will need to
remember to move the bitmap files relative to the new location or
they won't be found.

You can also use this tab to specify
your preferred default image command, which may be either
\gls{pgfimage} or \gls{includegraphics}.


\subsubsection{Application Paths}\label{sec:processes}

\widgetdef{processes.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:configdialog-apppaths}
  {\includeimg{configureDialog-apppaths}}
  {Configuration Dialog Box (Application Paths)}

If you \filefn{export} your image to PDF, EPS or SVG
\FlowframTk\ will first save the image as an encapsulated \LaTeX\
document and will then run external applications to create the
desired file format. In order to do this, \FlowframTk\ needs to know
the correct paths to these applications. It will try to find them
from your system's \gls{PATH} environment variable, but if it
can't find them you can use the \widget{processes.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:configdialog-apppaths}) to set their locations.  The
\file{libgs} library is needed by \app{dvisvgm}, so you only
need it if you intend to export to \gls{svg}.

To reduce the chance of zombie processes, each process is run with a
timer that will kill the process if it exceeds the value specified
in the \widget{processes.timeout} box.


\subsection{\TeX\ Settings Dialog}\label{sec:texconfig}

\menudef{menu.settings.configtex}

The \menu{settings.configtex} menu item will open up 
the \inlineglsdef{texconfig.title} dialog box
in which you can adjust the \TeX\slash\LaTeX\ settings.
(\sectionref{sec:configuredialog} covers image settings
and \sectionref{sec:configureuidialog} covers user interface settings.)


\subsubsection{Setting the Document Class and Normal Font Size}
\label{sec:normalsize}

\widgetdef{clssettings.title}

Most of \FlowframTk's \TeX\slash\LaTeX\ related functions (including the
applicable \filefn{export} formats) require a value
corresponding to \gls{normalsize} (the \LaTeX\ command that sets the
\gls{normal-font-size}). A \gls{textarea} needs to know the normal
font size to determine the appropriate font size declaration (see
\sectionref{sec:fontsize}). In addition, both the
\gls{menu.tex.parshape} and \gls{menu.tex.shapepar} functions use
the value of \gls{baselineskip} for the normal font size in order to
determine the location of the scan lines used to compute the
required parameters. This also means that any static or dynamic
frames (\sectionref{sec:flowframe}) that use a non-standard paragraph
shape also require this information.

\FloatFig
 {fig:normalsize}
 {\includeimg{normalsizeandclass}}
 {Setting the Normal Font Size and (optionally) the Class}

\widgetdef{clssettings.normalsize}

The \gls{normal-font-size} can be set using the
\widget{clssettings.title} tab (\figureref{fig:normalsize}).  Select the
required value from the \widget{clssettings.normalsize} \gls{dropdown} and select
\dgls{okay} to set it. Note that you must remember
to use this value in your document. For example, if you set the
normal size as 20, your document will need to use one of the
\sty{extsizes} class files, e.g.\ \cls{extarticle}, and specify
20\gls{pt} as one of the optional arguments:
\begin{codebox}
\cmd{documentclass}[20pt]\marg{extarticle}
\end{codebox}

The largest normal size listed is 25pt (the value is actually
24.88pt, but \FlowframTk\ lists it as 25pt) which is for use with the
\cls{a0poster} class file. Remember that for very large or very
small fonts, you will need to use scalable fonts in your document to
prevent font size substitutions.  Available values, along with the
corresponding value of \gls{baselineskip} and the file in which they
are defined, are listed in \tableref{tab:normalsize}.

\FloatTable

[Available Values for the Normal Font Size]
{Available values for the normal font size, the corresponding value
and the file in which they are defined (relative to the TEXMF
tree).}

\widgetdef{clssettings.update}

If the \widget{clssettings.update} \gls*{checkbox} is selected,
changing the normal size setting in this dialog will update the
\LaTeX\ font size settings for all the \glspl{textarea} in the
current image.

\widgetdef{clssettings.default_cls}

If you want to export your image to a complete \LaTeX\ document (see
\sectionref{sec:exportdoc}) the \inlineglsdef{document-class} will default to:
\begin{itemize}
\item \cls{article}, if the normal size is
set to 10, 11 or 12;
\item \cls{a0poster}, if the normal size is set to
25;
\item \cls{extarticle}, otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\widgetdef{clssettings.custom_cls}

If you want to use a different \gls{document-class}, select the
\widget{clssettings.custom_cls} radio button, which will enable the
field where you can type the require class name (without the
\filefmt{.cls} extension). You need to ensure the class supports your
specified normal font size (as a standard option, not a key=value
option).

The \gls{document-class} is also used as the base class with the export to
document class function (see \sectionref{sec:exportsty}) and is used
for all \filefn{export} functions that use the export to encapsulated \LaTeX\
document function as an intermediate step.

\widgetdef{clssettings.relative_fontsize}

The \widget{clssettings.relative_fontsize} \gls*{checkbox} governs
the suggested \LaTeX\ font size command when you change the
\hyperref[sec:fontsize]{font size setting} for \glspl{textarea}. If
this \gls*{checkbox} is selected, \FlowframTk\ will attempt to select a
font size declaration, such as \gls{large}, according to the current
normalsize setting. Otherwise, \gls{setfontsize} will be used. If
the font size is significantly larger than the largest available
declaration, \gls{setfontsize} will be used regardless of this
setting.

\widgetdef{clssettings.pdfinfo}

The \widget{clssettings.pdfinfo} \gls*{checkbox} governs whether or
not to add \gls{pdfinfo} to exported \LaTeX\ documents. If the image
has a description (\sectionref{sec:imagedescription}), this will be
added to the \gls{pdfinfo/Title} attribute. The only other attribute
that is set is the \gls{pdfinfo/CreationDate} attribute. This setting is
not used for the export to PostScript or \gls{svg} functions as they
use \app{latex} rather than \app{pdflatex}.

\widgetdef{clssettings.use_typeblock_as_bbox}

When an image is exported to an encapsulated \LaTeX\ document
or complete \LaTeX\ document, by default the image \gls{image.bbox}
is calculated as the minimal sized rectangle that encompasses all
\glspl{object} on the \gls{canvas}. If the image contains an
\glspl*{textarea}, this may result in text being clipped to the left
or right of the image due to the font differences. In this case, or
if you require a different bounding box for some other reason, then
switch on the \widget{clssettings.use_typeblock_as_bbox}
\gls*{checkbox} and if the image has a \gls{image.typeblock} set
(see \sectionref{sec:typeblock}) the \gls{image.typeblock} will be used as the image
\gls{image.bbox}. If the image doesn't have a \gls{image.typeblock} set, then the
default bounding box will be used. See also \figureref{fig:equation}
in \sectionref{sec:exportdoc}.


\subsubsection{Flowframe Settings}\label{sec:texconfigflf}

\widgetdef{flfsettings.title}

\FloatFig
 {fig:flfsettings}
 {\includeimg{flfsettings}}
 {Flowframe Settings Tab}

The \widget{flfsettings.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:flfsettings}) allows you to adjust the
\sty{flowfram} related settings.

The \sty{flowfram} package now allows you to use absolute pages
numbers in the page list rather than using the value of the
\ctr{page} counter. For example, if your document pages are numbered
a, b, i, ii, iii, 1, 2, 3, then with the absolute setting page
number 3 refers to the page \manmsg{labelled} i whereas with the
relative setting page number 3 refers to both the page
\manmsg{labelled} iii and the page \manmsg{labelled} 3. (See the
\sty{flowfram} documentation for further details.) If you want to
use the absolute setting, select the
\widget{flfsettings.pages_opt.absolute} button otherwise select the
\widget{flfsettings.pages_opt.relative} button.

The \sty{shapepar} package now has a command called
\gls{Shapepar} that behaves slightly differently to
\gls{shapepar}. Since \gls{Shapepar} works better than
\gls{shapepar} when used with the \sty{flowfram} package,
\FlowframTk\ defaults to using \gls{Shapepar} for the
\gls{menu.tex.shapepar} function or when a
\hyperref[sec:flowframe]{static or dynamic frame} has the
shape set to \widget{flowframe.shape_shapepar}. However, if
you prefer the original \gls{shapepar} command, selected the
appropriate \widget{flfsettings.shapeparcs} radio button.
If you want to use \gls{Shapepar}, you need to ensure you have
up-to-date versions of the \sty{flowfram} and \sty{shapepar}
packages. This setting applies both to frames with the
\widget{flowframe.shape_shapepar} shape setting and to the
\gls{menu.tex.shapepar} function.

\subsubsection{Text Settings}\label{sec:texconfigtext}

\widgetdef{textconfig.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:configdialog-texsettings}
  {\includeimg{configureDialog-texsettings}}
  {LaTeX-Related Text Settings}

The \widget{textconfig.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:configdialog-texsettings})
allows you to adjust the text-related settings.

\widgetdef{textconfig.anchor}

If the \widget{textconfig.anchor} \gls{checkbox} is selected,
whenever you \hyperref[sec:alignobjects]{justify} a \gls{group}, any
\glspl{textarea} in that group will have their
\textattrpl{anchor} automatically adjusted.

\widgetdef{textconfig.textualshading}

\FlowframTk\ can't implement \dgls{gradient-paint} for text when
\hyperref[sec:exportpgf]{exporting} to \sty{pgf}. (This includes the
\filefn{export} functions that use \app{latex} or \app{pdflatex}, such as
the export to PDF function.) You can choose how \FlowframTk\ should export
shaded text using the \widget{textconfig.textualshading} dropdown
box. Available options:

\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle
 {\inlineglsdef{textconfig.textualshading.average}}

\begin{itemdesc}
The text will be given the \manmsg{colour} obtained by averaging the
shading's start and end \manmsg{colour}.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle
 {\inlineglsdef{textconfig.textualshading.start}}

\begin{itemdesc}
Just the shading's start \manmsg{colour} will be used.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle
 {\inlineglsdef{textconfig.textualshading.end}}

\begin{itemdesc}
Just the shading's end \manmsg{colour} will be used.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle
 {\inlineglsdef{textconfig.textualshading.path}}

\begin{itemdesc}
The text will be exported as a path rather than text. This means
that the \LaTeX\ alternative text attribute will be ignored. This is
equivalent to applying the 
\hyperref[sec:outlinetopath]{convert outline to path}, 
\hyperref[sec:grouping]{ungroup} and 
\hyperref[sec:mergepaths]{merge path}
functions (without actually changing your image).
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

\widgetdef{textconfig.textpathoutline}

\FlowframTk\ can't implement the text
\hyperref[sec:textoutline]{outline} option for
\glspl{textpath} when exporting to \sty{pgf}. (Again, this
includes the export functions that use \app{latex} or \app{pdflatex}.)
You can choose how \FlowframTk\ should export \gls{textpath}
outlines using the \widget{textconfig.textpathoutline}
dropdown box. Available options:

\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle
 {\inlineglsdef{textconfig.textpathoutline.path}}

\begin{itemdesc}
The \gls{textpath} will be exported as a path rather than a
\gls{textpath}. This means that the \LaTeX\
alternative text attribute will be ignored. This is equivalent to
applying the
\hyperref[sec:outlinetopath]{convert outline to path}, 
\hyperref[sec:grouping]{ungroup} and 
\hyperref[sec:mergepaths]{merge path}
functions, without actually changing your image.
(This option will always override the shading options described
above, if the \gls{textpath} has a shading.)
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle
 {\inlineglsdef{textconfig.textpathoutline.ignore}}

\begin{itemdesc}
The outline attribute will be ignored.
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

\iconstartpar{textarea,math}%
\plabel[TeX Mappings]{mi:texmappings}%
\FlowframTk\ has two tools for creating \glspl{textarea}: the
regular text-mode tool (\menu{tools.textarea}) and the
\manmsg{maths}-mode tool (\menu{tools.math}). Each \gls{textarea} has an
associated \LaTeX\ alternative text which, if set, is used
during the \sty{pgf} export operations in place of the
text displayed on the \gls{canvas}. (This includes the export
functions that use \app{latex} or \app{pdflatex}, such as
the export to PDF function.) The \mathstool\ automatically
inserts \glsname{mshift} at the start and end of the
alternative text. 

If the \inlineglsdef{textarea-mapping} are enabled, Unicode symbols present in
the text when a new \gls*{textarea} is constructed can be mapped to
a \LaTeX\ command.
The mappings applied depend on which tool has been selected. With
the regular \texttool, all the ten \TeX\ special characters are
mapped to commands. In addition, there are some other characters
that are also mapped by default. These are listed in the table shown
in the \widget{textconfig.textmode} tab (see
\figureref{fig:configdialog-texsettings}). If you don't want any
text mappings applied, deselect the
\widget{textconfig.escape} \gls{checkbox}.

With the \mathstool, the \gls{hash} and \gls{percent} characters are the
only two of the ten \TeX\ special characters that are mapped by
default. However there are other mappings of \manmsg{maths}-related Unicode
characters and these are listed in the table shown in the
\widget{textconfig.mathmode} tab (see
\figureref{fig:configdialog-mathsettings}). If you don't want
\mathsmode\ mappings applied, deselect the
\widget{textconfig.escape.mathchar} \gls*{checkbox}.

\FloatFig
  {fig:configdialog-mathsettings}
  {\includeimg{configureDialog-mathsettings}}
  {LaTeX-Related Text Settings\dash \Manmsg{maths}-Mode Mappings}

The mapping tables can be sorted by \glslink{click}{clicking} on
their column headers. You can add, delete or modify any of these
\textmode\ or \mathsmode\ mappings. Any mapping that ends with a control
word (a backslash followed by one or more letters) should
usually be followed by a space or \verb|{}| to prevent it from
running into any subsequent letter when the mapping is applied. For
\textmode\ mappings, \verb|{}| is better in case the command is
followed by an intended space, although this may depend on the
command definition. For \mathsmode\ mappings it's better
to follow the control word with a space.

One or more rows in a mapping table can be selected with the mouse.
You can use \keys{\keyref{shift}}+\gls{click} or 
\keys{\keyref{ctrl}}+\gls{click} to add to the
current selection.

\widgetdef{textconfig.remove.textmap}

To delete a mapping or mappings, select the appropriate row or rows of the
mapping table and click on the \widget{textconfig.remove.textmap} button
to the side of the table.  To restore all the original mappings,
quit \FlowframTk\ and delete or rename the files
\file{mathmappings.prop} and \file{textmappings.prop} in the
\gls{config_dir}.

To edit an existing mapping, \gls{doubleclick} on the second and
third columns of the mapping table. The first two columns can't be
edited.

\widgetdef{textconfig.add.textmap}
\plabel[New \TeX\ Mappings]{mi:newtexmappings}% HelpSet id
To add a new mapping, \gls{click} on the green plus button to the
side of the relevant table.  This will open the add new mapping
dialog. Enter the character you want mapped in the
\widget{textconfig.symbol} box or type the hexadecimal value in the
\widget{textconfig.codepoint} box and then enter the replacement
command in the \widget{textconfig.command} box.  If the command is
defined in a package, enter the package name (without the \ext{sty}
extension) in the \widget{textconfig.package} box. If the mapping
requires multiple commands from different packages, you can specify
a comma-separated list of packages in the
\widget{textconfig.package} box. If the replacement command is
available in the \LaTeX\ kernel, you can leave this box blank.
(These packages will be automatically added to the
\hyperref[sec:preamble]{image's early-preamble} code, whenever the
mapping is applied.)

The package name may be preceded by optional arguments in square
brackets, for example \code{[weather]ifsym} (note that the package name
isn't enclosed in braces). Set the package name to \qt{none} or
leave it empty if you don't want it automatically added to the early-preamble
code when the mappings are applied.

For example, in \figureref{fig:addTeXMapping} the new mapping dialog
is being used to define a new text mapping from the Unicode dagger
\textdagger\ symbol (U+2020) to the \csfmt{textdagger} command.
Since this command is defined in the \LaTeX\ kernel, the package
field can be left empty. The Unicode symbol can be specified either
by typing the hexadecimal code into the
\widget{textconfig.codepoint} field or by typing the actual
symbol into the \widget{textconfig.symbol} field. If there
is already a mapping for this Unicode symbol, the old mapping will
be overwritten.

\FloatFig
  {fig:addTeXMapping}
  {\includeimg{addTeXMapping}}
  {Adding a New Text Mapping} 

\widgetdef{textconfig.textmappings.import}
You can also import mappings from a tab-separated file (\ext{tsv})
where the first column is the hexadecimal code, the second column is
the command (or commands) and the third column is the package name
or comma-separated list of packages. Any additional columns are
ignored, as are blank lines or lines starting with \gls{hash}. The file
shouldn't contain any delimiters nor may any of
the cells contain a newline or tab character. For example,
the file may look like:
\begin{verbatim}
00260E  \Telephone      [misc]ifsym
0026A1  \Lightning      [weather]ifsym
\end{verbatim}

You can find extra mappings using the Symbol Lookup page at
\url{http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/symbol-lookup.php} which
has a web form you can use to look up mappings in the database.  If
the mapping ends with a control word the import function will
automatically append a space for \mathsmode\ or
\verb|{}| for \textmode, unless the Unicode character type is one
of: combining spacing mark, connector punctuation, modifier symbol
or modifier letter, in which case just a space is appended.
(This adjustment isn't done for the edit mapping or
add a single-mapping functions described above. You need to do this
yourself, as I did in \figureref{fig:addTeXMapping}.) If this
adjustment isn't appropriate, you can edit the mapping to remove it.

For example, in \figureref{fig:symbolLookup}, I've selected the
\qt{Latin-1 Supplement} block with the mode set to \qt{text}. If I
then click on the \qt{Search} button at the bottom of the form, this
will list all the mappings listed in the database that match. To
import these values into \FlowframTk, you first need to download
them in the correct format. Set the \qt{Results Format}
\gls{dropdown} to TSV (\emph{not CSV}) and click on the
\qt{Search} button. Depending on your browser, this may
automatically save the file \filefmt{symbol-lookup.tsv} in your
downloads directory\slash folder or it may try to open the file.
Be careful if it tries to open the file in a spreadsheet application
as this may change the format to one that's not compatible with
\FlowframTk.

\FloatFig
  {fig:symbolLookup}
  {\includeimg[width=0.9\textwidth]{symbol-lookup}}
  {Symbol Lookup Script}

If you try this search on the Symbol Lookup page and open the file in your
\manmsg{favourite} text editor, you may notice that some codepoints are listed
multiple times. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
0000A3  \textsterling   none    text    0
0000A3  \pounds         none    both    0
\end{verbatim}
If you simply import the file into \FlowframTk, new mappings will
override the earlier mappings, so in this case the mapping for
U+A3 will be set to \csfmt{pounds} rather than
\csfmt{textsterling} so delete any of the mappings you don't want
before you import the file.

This example also produces mappings that require the \sty{fontenc}
package. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
0000AB  \guillemotleft  fontenc text    0
\end{verbatim}
This indicates commands that are part of the \LaTeX\ kernel but don't
work with the default OT1 font encoding. In my case, I've set my
\gls{preamble.default} to include
\sty{fontenc} with the T1 encoding, so I don't want that package
automatically added to my early-preamble code. To fix this, I just need to
use my text-editor's search-and-replace function to replace all instances of
\qt{fontenc} with \qt{none} before I import this file. If you don't
have this package in the default preamble, you'll need to add the appropriate
option.  For example, change the line to:
\begin{verbatim}
0000AB  \guillemotleft  [T1]fontenc     text    0
\end{verbatim}
(Again, you can use your text-editor's search-and-replace function.)
Similarly, if you want to import any of the symbol maps that include
commands from the \sty{mathdesign} package, you'll need to add
the option to set the required font. For example
\begin{verbatim}
002231  \intclockwise   [utopia]mathdesign      math    1
\end{verbatim}

Once all these modifications have been made, the file can then be
imported by clicking on the import button in the appropriate mapping
pane. In this case, I have fetched mappings that are valid in
\textmode, so I need to select the \widget{textconfig.textmode} tab
and then click on the import button to the right of the mapping
table. This will open a file chooser which I can use to select the
TSV file.

\begin{warning}
Note that mappings take up resources and the more mappings you have,
the longer it will take to startup \FlowframTk, so it's best to only
add the mappings that you're likely to need. The symbol lookup form
on the Dickimaw Books website has a maximum limit of 500 for the search
results. (A smaller limit can be set if required. The default value
is 200.)
\end{warning}

\subsubsection{Default Preamble}\label{sec:texconfigpreamble}

\widgetdef{preambleconfig.title}

The \widget{preambleconfig.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:texconfig-preamble}) allows you to set the
\inlineglsdef{preamble.default} code that
should always be added to the preamble when exporting images to
complete \LaTeX\ documents or formats that use the encapsulated
\LaTeX\ document function as an intermediate step (see
\sectionref{sec:exportdoc}). This code isn't used for the export to
class (\ext{cls}) or package (\ext{sty}) functions.

\FloatFig
  {fig:texconfig-preamble}
  {\includeimg{texconfig-preamble}}
  {Default Preamble Code}

The \gls{preamble.default} code is stored in a file called
\file{preamble.tex} in \FlowframTk's \gls{config_dir}. If you edit
this file outside of \FlowframTk, you'll need to use the reload
button to refresh this panel. The other buttons are the same as for
the \TeX\ editor described in \sectionref{sec:texeditor}.  You can
also access these button actions through the
\gls{index.menu.texeditor} context menu, which can be opened using
a~\gls{menuclick} on the editor pane.


\subsection{Configure User Interface}\label{sec:configureuidialog}

\menudef{menu.settings.configui}

The menu item \menu{settings.configui} will open up 
the \inlineglsdef{configui.title} dialog box
in which you can adjust the user interface settings.
(\sectionref{sec:configuredialog} covers image settings
and \sectionref{sec:texconfig} covers \TeX\slash\LaTeX\ related
settings.)


\subsubsection{Graphics Settings}\label{sec:graphics}

\widgetdef{graphics.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:graphics}
  {\includeimg{configureUI-graphics}}
  {Configuration UI Dialog Box (Graphics Settings)}

The \widget{graphics.title} tab (\figureref{fig:graphics})
allows you to make adjustments to the way the image is rendered on
the \gls{canvas}.

\widgetdef{render.anti_alias}

If enabled, use \gls{anti-aliasing} to draw the image.

\widgetdef{render.rendering}

Choose between speed or quality in the \gls{rendering}.

\widgetdef{editpathui.title}

The \widget{editpathui.title} area has the following settings that
relate to the \editpathmode.

\widgetdef{editpathui.canvasclick}

If enabled, this setting will cause a mouse \gls{click} on the
\gls{canvas} outside of any of the \glspl{controlpt} to exit
\editpathmode.

\widgetdef{editpathui.ignorelock}

If enabled, the \gridlock\ will be ignored when using the
mouse to select a \gls{controlpt} in \editpathmode.

\widgetdef{render.control.standard}

Set the \manmsg{colour} for the regular
\glspl*{controlpt} according to whether they are selected or
unselected.

\widgetdef{render.control.symmetry}

Set the \manmsg{colour} for the \gls{line-of-symmetry}
\glspl*{controlpt} according to whether they are selected or
unselected.

\widgetdef{render.control.patternanchor}

Set the \manmsg{colour} for the pattern \gls{pattern.anchor}
\glspl*{controlpt} according to whether they are selected or
unselected.

\widgetdef{render.control.patternadjust}

Set the \manmsg{colour} for the pattern 
\glspl*{pattern.adjustment-controlpt} according to whether they are selected or
unselected.

\plabel[Hotspots]{mi:hotspots}%
\widgetdef{hotspots.title}

\iconstartpar{hotspots.png,nohotspots.png}%
\Inlineglspluraldef{hotspot} are regions around an \gls*{object}['s] 
\gls{selection-bbox} that can be used to perform freehand
transformations.
You can use the \widget{graphics.title} tab to choose between
enabling (left icon) and disabling (right icon) \glspl{hotspot} along the
\glspl{selection-bbox}. If \glspl{hotspot} are enabled, you can scale, rotate or
shear \glspl{object} by dragging the appropriate \gls{hotspot}. (Note that
transforming \glspl{compositeshape} applies the transformation to
the \emph{underlying} shape not to the shape as a whole.)

You may want to disable this option when you want to move small
objects, or you may end up transforming them instead of moving them.
When this option is enabled, the cursor will change
shape when you move it over the edge of the \gls{selection-bbox}.
(The actual cursor appearance depends on the look and
feel of the platform you are using. On some systems the South and
North arrows may look the same, and similarly for the East and West
arrows.)
\figureref{fig:hotspotsa} shows how the \gls{bbox} is displayed
when \glspl{hotspot} are enabled and \figureref{fig:hotspotsb} shows
how the \gls{selection-bbox} is displayed when the \glspl{hotspot} have been
disabled. Each \gls{hotspot} is represented by a small square. Available
functions are listed in \tableref{tab:hotspotfunctions}.

\FloatTable
{tab:hotspotfunctions}
{%
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\bfseries Hotspot & \bfseries Function &
\bfseries Cursor Appearance\\
Bottom left & rotate & hand\\

Bottom right & scale both directions & South-East arrow\\
Middle right & scale horizontally & East arrow\\
Top right & shear vertically & North arrow\\
Top left & shear horizontally & West arrow
\end{tabular}
}
{Hotspot Functions}
 
Note that even if you have more than one \gls{object} \selected, only the
object whose \gls{hotspot} you are dragging will be transformed.
As may be predicted, using \glspl{hotspot} is not as precise as using the
transformation dialog boxes described in
\sectionref{sec:selectobjects}.

\subsubsection{Annotations Settings}\label{sec:annotations}

\widgetdef{annotations.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:annotations}
  {\includeimg{configureUI-annotations}}
  {Configuration UI Dialog Box (Annotations Settings)}

The \widget{annotations.title} tab (\figureref{fig:annotations})
allows you to set the font used for annotating frames or draft
\glspl{bitmap} and set the font used on the splash screen during startup.


\subsubsection{Language Settings}\label{sec:languages}

\widgetdef{lang.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:languages}
  {\includeimg{configureUI-languages}}
  {Configuration UI Dialog Box (Language Settings)}

You can use the \widget{lang.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:graphics})
to set which language to use for the application
resources (menus, messages etc) and which language to use for
the manual. These settings will not be applied until you quit and
restart \FlowframTk.

You can also use the \widget{lang.title} tab to specify the
Unicode blocks to display in the
\hyperref[mi:insertsymbol]{symbol selector}. By default, only
a limited subsection of Unicode characters are available because it
would significantly slow \FlowframTk's startup process to provide
all possible characters. To add a new block, \gls{click} on the
green plus button next to the table. To remove an unwanted block,
select the appropriate row in the table and \gls{click} on the red minus
button. The start and end values don't need to match a complete
Unicode block and may span multiple blocks. For example, suppose you
regularly want to enter musical symbols into your image, then you
can add a block starting from 1D100 and ending at 1D1DD. You need to
quit and restart \FlowframTk\ for the changes to take effect. If you
want to restore the defaults, quit \FlowframTk, open the file
\file{flowframtk.conf} in the \gls{config_dir} and remove
the line starting with \qt{unicode=}.

\subsubsection{Accelerator Settings}\label{sec:accelerators}

\widgetdef{accelerators.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:accelerators}
  {\includeimg{configureUI-accelerators}}
  {Configuration UI Dialog Box (Accelerators)}

You can use the \widget{accelerators.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:accelerators}) to change the default accelerators
(keyboard shortcuts). It's possible to use the same keystroke for
different actions provided the actions are never both enabled at the
same time. (For example, \accelerator{menu.editpath.next_control}
selects the next control in path edit mode or adjust the selection
in \selectmode.)

\begin{information}
Java's accessibility API uses \accelerator{action.menubarfocus} to switch
the focus to the menu bar, so avoid using this key for an
accelerator.
\end{information}

Suppose you want to change the accelerator for the \menu{edit.undo}
function from the default \accelerator{menu.edit.undo} to, say,
\keys{\keyref{ctrl}+\keyref{shift}+U}. Find the appropriate row in
the accelerator table and \gls{doubleclick} on it to open the
\widget{accelerator.set} dialog box
(\figureref{fig:setaccelerator}).

\FloatFig
  {fig:setaccelerator}
  {\includeimg{setaccelerator}}
  {Changing a keyboard shortcut.}

There are two ways to change the
keystroke. If the \widget{accelerator.set.useselector}
button is selected, you can select or deselect the required
modifiers (such as \widget{accelerator.set.shift}) and
use the drop-down box to select the keystroke. So to change the
keystroke to \keys{\keyref{ctrl}+\keyref{shift}+\actualkey{U}}, select the
\widget{accelerator.set.shift} and
\widget{accelerator.set.ctrl} \glspl{checkbox} and set the drop-down
box to \widgetfmt{pressed U}.

Alternatively, if the \widget{accelerator.set.usekeystroke} button
is selected you can type the required keystroke in the
\widget{accelerator.set.usekeystroke.label} field. Care must be
taken with this option. You need to make sure you release the main
key before releasing the modifiers. For example, press down the
\desckeyref{ctrl}, \desckeyref{shift} and \keys{\actualkey{U}} keys
but release the \keys{\actualkey{U}} key before releasing the
\keys{\keyref{ctrl}} and \keys{\keyref{shift}} keys. 

Note that the \desckeyref{tab} key retains its usual
function of moving the focus to the next component in the window,
and so can't be typed in the
\widget{accelerator.set.usekeystroke.label} field. (Neither
can certain other keys that are always intercepted by the operating
system.) The \desckeyref{return} key, on the other hand, will be picked up
by the \widget{accelerator.set.usekeystroke.label} field
if it has the focus, so you need to ensure you move the focus to a
different component if you want to use \keys{\keyref{return}} to activate the
\btn{okay} button.

The accelerator settings are written to a file called
\inlineglsdef{file.accelerators.prop} in the \gls{config_dir} when
\FlowframTk\ quits normally. You may edit this file using your
preferred text editor to change the settings as long as \FlowframTk\
isn't currently running. For example, if you want to change all the
keystrokes that require the control key to be pressed to requiring
the meta key pressed instead, you may find it easier to do a global
search and replace in \file{accelerators.prop} of \code{ctrl}
with \code{meta}. If you do edit this file, make sure you only
edit the values to the right of the \code{=} sign. To restore the
default accelerators, delete or rename this file (when \FlowframTk\
isn't running).

\subsubsection{Toolbar, Ruler and Status Bar Settings}\label{sec:rulers}

\widgetdef{borders.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:rulers}
  {\includeimg{configureUI-rulers}}
  {Configuration UI Dialog Box (Toolbar, Ruler and Status Bar Settings)}

You can use the \widget{borders.title} tab (\figureref{fig:rulers})
to customise the \glspl{ruler}, \glspl{toolbar} and \gls{statusbar}.
You can show or hide the \glspl{toolbar} using the
\widget{borders.showtools} checkbox. If this check box is selected,
you can also specify the location of the vertical toolbar.

\iconstartpar{toolbarleft,toolbarright}%
The vertical toolbar is located on the left of \FlowframTk's main
window by default, but can be switched to the right by selecting the
\widget{borders.vtoolbar} \widget{borders.vtoolbar.right} radio
button. You will need to quit and restart for the change to take
effect.

The width (in pixels) of the vertical ruler can be specified in the
\widget{borders.rulerwidth} field, and the height (in pixels) of
the horizontal ruler can be specified in the
\widget{borders.rulerheight} field. For example, if you find that
the $y$ co-ordinates don't fit on the vertical ruler, you can make the
ruler wider, say, to 30 pixels. There's a sample panel on the right
that shows the dimensions (but doesn't show the ruler annotations).

The way the co-ordinates appear on the rulers is governed by the
\widget{borders.rulerpattern} field.  The pattern syntax is as for
\href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html}{\filefmt{java.text.DecimalFormat}},
described in the Java API.  You can also set the locale governing
the pattern, but this pattern is only applied to the \glspl{ruler},
not to the co-ordinate dialog boxes or \gls{statusbar}. The font
used by the rulers can also be changed.  This panel doesn't provide
a setting to show or hide the rulers as this is done for the
currently selected \gls{canvas} using the main menu item
\menu{settings.rulers}.

You can show or hide the \gls{statusbar} using the
\widget{borders.showstatus} check box. If this box is
selected, you can additionally choose to show or hide the
individual \gls{statusbar} elements.

\seealsorefs{sec:thetoolbars,sec:therulers,sec:thestatusbar}

\subsubsection{Normalization}\label{sec:normalize}

\widgetdef{normalize.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:normalize}
  {\includeimg{configureUI-normalize}}
  {Configuration UI Dialog Box (Normalization)}

When an image is \glslink{painting}{drawn} on the \gls{canvas} via Java's painting
methods, the co-ordinates of all the objects are converted into
PostScript points (including any scaling applied by the zoom
settings). However, it is rare for any display device, such as a
standard monitor, to have pixels that are exactly one PostScript point square
in size. This means that a 1in (or 72\gls{bp}) line drawn on the
screen at 100\% magnification may not actually measure 1in if you
hold a ruler up against the screen. This is fairly typical for
most graphical applications but, if it bothers you, you can
adjust the horizontal and vertical normalization factors used by
\FlowframTk\ in the \widget{normalize.title} tab
(\figureref{fig:normalize}).

If you happen to already know the normalization factors
for your device, you can enter them in the
\widget{normalize.norm.x} and
\widget{normalize.norm.y} fields. If you don't know them,
\FlowframTk\ can compute them for you. To do this, you need to hold
a ruler against the \widget{normalize.nonorm_horizontal}
line, enter the measurement in the length field below the line and
\gls{click} on the \widget{normalize.x_compute_norm} button. This
will insert the normalization factor into the
\widget{normalize.norm.x} field. Next, hold the ruler
against the \widget{normalize.nonorm_vertical} line, enter
the measurement in the length field below that line and \gls{click} on the
\widget{normalize.y_compute_norm} button. This will insert
the normalization factor into the \widget{normalize.norm.y}
field. You then need to \gls{click} on the okay button to set these
normalization factors.

\subsubsection{\TeX\ Editor Settings}\label{sec:texeditorui}

\widgetdef{texeditorui.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:texeditorui}
  {\includeimg{configureUI-texeditorui}}
  {Configuration UI Dialog Box (TeX Editor Settings)}

\FlowframTk\ has small text editor that's opened when you want to
edit the contents of a static or dynamic frame.
The font used by this editor can be changed in the
\widget{texeditorui.title} tab (\figureref{fig:texeditorui}).
You can also set the default width (in terms of approximate number
of characters per line) and the default height (in terms of lines)
for the editor when it's first created at startup. You can also
enable or disable syntax highlighting by selecting or deselecting
the button marked \widget{texeditorui.highlight}. If
selected, you can also set the \manmsg{colour} used for comments
(indicated by \TeX's \glssymbol{percent} comment character) or for commands. The
editor currently doesn't have any spell-checking support.
The \hyperref[sec:texconfigpreamble]{default preamble} panel
of the \dialog{texconfig} dialog also
uses these settings.

In \FlowframTk\ version 0.7, this editor window was also used for changing the
preamble text, but as from version~0.8, the preamble editor has been
switched to a pane attached to the \gls{canvas} that can remain open
while you're editing the image. This pane uses these settings,
except for the default width and height, which is now governed
by the size of the \gls{canvas} window and the location of the
divider. By default, the preamble pane is to the right of the
\gls{canvas}, but you can change this using the radio buttons in the
\widget{texeditorui.split} area.

\seealsorefs{sec:thepreamblepane,sec:flowframe,sec:texeditor}

\subsubsection{Look and Feel Settings}\label{sec:lookandfeel}

\widgetdef{lookandfeel.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:lookandfeel}
  {\includeimg{configureUI-lookandfeel}}
  {Configuration UI Dialog Box (Look and Feel Settings)}

Java displays \gls{gui} elements, such as buttons and menus,
according to the selected \qt{\gls{look-and-feel}}. There are a number of
different \glspl{look-and-feel} that may, or may not, be available on your
platform. Some of the \glspl{look-and-feel} don't support certain features
such as the click-to-collapse setting on the divider bar in split
panes, including the divider between the \gls{canvas} and the preamble
pane. The \widget{lookandfeel.title} tab has a
\gls{dropdown} with the list of available \gls{look-and-feel}. For
example, \figureref{fig:lookandfeel} has the \qt{Metal} look and
feel selected. You can change this to a different \gls{look-and-feel}, but
you must restart \FlowframTk\ for the change to be implemented.

Some example \glspl{look-and-feel} are shown in \figureref{fig:lookandfeelex}.
Note that the main window's title bar and outer border isn't
governed by Java's \gls{look-and-feel}, but by the operating
system's window manager. For example, I've used different window
themes whilst taking snapshots of \FlowframTk\ for this manual,
which is why the \manmsg{colour} and format of the title bar for the main
window and for the dialog boxes vary.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:lookandfeelex}
{
  {fig:lookandfeelex-metal}
    {\includeimg[alt={Metal Look and Feel}]{lookandfeel-metal}}{Metal},

  {fig:lookandfeelex-gtk}
    {\includeimg[alt={GTK+ Look and Feel}]{lookandfeel-gtk}}{}
}
[Look and Feel Examples]
{Look and Feel Examples:

\subfigref{fig:lookandfeelex-nimbus} Nimbus;
\subfigref{fig:lookandfeelex-cdemotif} CDE\slash Motif;
\subfigref{fig:lookandfeelex-gtk} GTK+}

In addition to changing the look and feel, you can also change how
the buttons that have icons are displayed. By default, the buttons
with icons have a bevel bordered style, with a different icon image for
the up, down, rollover and disabled states, but if you don't like
them, you can select a different type from the
\widget{lookandfeel.button.style} area. Each type has some sample
buttons displayed on the right. They don't perform any actions, but
you can press them to try them out. The button types come in the
following \manmsgpl{flavour}:

\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{Bordered}

\begin{itemdesc}
This is the default button type described above.
These buttons have distinctive up and down states regardless of the
\gls{look-and-feel}.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{Small Bordered}

\begin{itemdesc}
Similar to bordered but a smaller version.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{Plain}

\begin{itemdesc}
This has a single icon image for the button. The up and
down look is dealt with by the \gls{look-and-feel}. This means that if the
selected look and feel doesn't draw an up or down effect, you won't
be able to see the button state.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{Small Plain}

\begin{itemdesc}
Similar to plain but a smaller version.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{Highlights}

\begin{itemdesc}
This is like plain but there is a
second icon for the down state of radio and check buttons that is
like the up state but has a highlighted background. This means that
you can now see a difference between the up and down states for the
radio and check buttons when used with a \gls{look-and-feel} style that
doesn't draw an up or down effect.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{Small Highlights}

\begin{itemdesc}
Similar to highlights but a smaller version.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{Bordered Switches}

\begin{itemdesc}
Uses the plain type for press buttons and
the bordered type icons for radio and check buttons. Unlike the
default bordered style, in this case the bordered icons also include
the \gls{look-and-feel}['s] up and down effect (where supported).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{Small Bordered Switches}

\begin{itemdesc}
Like bordered switches but a smaller version.
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

Some of these styles also display a textual label, which may be
above, below, to the left or to the right of the icon.
Alternatively, you can just select the text only option. If you
prefer to have a different style for the dialog windows, you can
uncheck the \widget{lookandfeel.dialog.as_general} button,
which will display a set of button styles that you can apply to the
dialog windows. For example, \figureref{fig:icontext} shows the
dialog window from \figureref{fig:graphics} with the
small icons and trailing text dialog button option.

As with the look and feel setting, you must restart \FlowframTk\
before the changes can be implemented.

\section{Configuration Directory}\label{sec:configdir}


When you quit \FlowframTk, the settings will be saved in
\FlowframTk's \inlineglsdef{config_dir}.  This directory is
determined (and created if necessary) as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If the environment variable \gls{JDRSETTINGS} exists
        and is a directory, that directory is used.

  \item If \FlowframTk\ detects the existence of \gls{JpgfDraw}['s]
        configuration directory, that will be used. If the file
        \file{jpgfdraw.conf} exists in that directory but the file
        \file{flowframtk.conf} doesn't exist, \FlowframTk\ will load the
        settings from \file{jpgfdraw.conf} and then save the new settings to
        \file{flowframtk.conf}. If you like, after you have quit
        \FlowframTk, you can remove the now unneeded file
        \file{jpgfdraw.conf} and rename the directory \file{.flowframtk} or
        \file{flowframtk-settings}, as appropriate.

  \item If the directory \file{home/.flowframtk} exists
        and is a directory, that directory is used (where
        \meta{home} indicates the user's home directory as given
        by the Java \code{user.home} property).

  \item If the directory \file{home/flowframtk-settings} exists
        and is a directory, that directory is used.

  \item If the operating system (as identified by the Java \code{os.name}
        property) is a version of Windows and the
        directory \file{home/flowframtk-settings} can
        be created, that directory is used.

  \item For other operating systems, if the directory
        \file{home/.flowframtk} can be created, that
        directory is used.

  \item If the directory \file{settings/user} or
        \file{settings} can be created in \FlowframTk's
        installation directory, that directory will be used
        (where \meta{user} is the current user's user name). This is
        sub-optimal and not recommended as it may be removed when
        upgrading to a new version.

  \item If none of the above, an error will occur and you will need
        to set the environment variable \gls{JDRSETTINGS} to
        a sensible location with read and write permissions.

\end{itemize}

The configuration directory may also contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item the list of \hyperref[sec:recentfiles]{recent files}
(written by \FlowframTk\ when it quits normally);

\item the \hyperref[sec:accelerators]{accelerator settings}
file \file{accelerators.prop}
(written by \FlowframTk\ when it quits normally);

\item the \mathsmode\ and \textmode\
\hyperref[sec:texconfigtext]{character mapping} files,
\file{mathmappings.prop} and \file{textmappings.prop}
(written by \FlowframTk\ when it quits normally);

\item the \hyperref[sec:preamble]{preamble} file \file{preamble.tex}
(created by you, if you want it, in any text editor) used by some of
the \filefn{export} functions
(see \sectionref{sec:texconfigpreamble});

\item the \file{languages.conf} file that stores the
\hyperref[sec:languages]{language settings} used for the resources and manual;

\item the \file{startup.conf} file that stores the names of the
fonts used by the \hyperref[sec:graphics]{startup splash screen};

\item the \file{latexfontmap.prop} file (created by you, if you want
it, in any text editor) that contains any \glspl{font-mapping} (see
\sectionref{sec:fontfamily}).  For compatibility with
\gls{JpgfDraw}, the file may simply be \filefmt{latexfontmap}
without an extension.

\end{itemize}

In addition, the configuration directory is used to save the log
file, \file{flowframtk.log}, in the event that
\accelerator{menu.debug.writelog} is used (or \menu{debug.writelog}
if the command line option \switch{debug} is used). The emergency
save all function \accelerator{menu.debug.dumpall} (or
\menu{debug.dumpall} if the command line option \switch{debug} is
used) will create a subdirectory (using the current date and time to
construct the name) and will save all open images to that directory
with filenames of the form \file{imagen.jdr}.

\chapter{The Basics}\label{sec:thebasics}

\FloatFig
  {fig:mainwindow}
  {\includeimg{jpdwindow}}
  {The Main Window}

\FlowframTk\ uses a \gls{mdi}. This means that you can have multiple
images loaded in separate child windows, without having to start up
new instances of \FlowframTk. Most of the buttons and menu items
will only be applied to the child window that currently has the
focus. If there are no child windows, or if they have all been
minimized, then the relevant buttons and menu items will be disabled.
The only exceptions are the non-\gls{canvas} specific items.
The main \FlowframTk\ window is shown in \figureref{fig:mainwindow}.


\section{The Canvas}\label{sec:thecanvas}

The \inlineglsdef{canvas} is the white area (that may optionally
have a~grid) in each of \FlowframTk's child windows on which you create
your picture. It shares a~child window with the
\hyperref[sec:thepreamblepane]{preamble editor pane}. The canvas and
preamble areas are separated by a divider that can be adjusted to
allow one side to take up more room in the window. This can be done
by dragging the divider.  With some \glspl{look-and-feel}, the
divider has small triangular buttons which you can click on to
collapse or expand one side, but not all have this function nor can
some of them completely hide the \gls{preamble} pane (such as the GTK+
Look and Feel).  You can also use the \menu{tex.set_preamble} menu
item to show the preamble pane.

In \selectmode\ (but not when you're editing or
distorting a shape) you can \gls{drag-and-drop} image files or
text onto the canvas to add to the current image. With the
\texttool\ or \mathstool\ you can only \gls{drag-and-drop} text onto
the canvas. If you attempt to drop a file instead, you will get a
new \gls{textarea} containing the file's path (or URI). 

\section{The Preamble Pane}\label{sec:thepreamblepane}

The preamble pane by default is on the right of the \gls{canvas},
which may be used to specify code that should go in the document
preamble of exported files. (This includes exports that use \LaTeX\
as an intermediate step.)

This area is split into three tabs for the early preamble code,
the mid-preamble code, and the late preamble code.
See \sectionref{sec:preamble} for further details on how this
code is added during the export process, and
see \sectionref{sec:configureuidialog} to set a default preamble
for all images and to reposition the preamble pane.

\section{The Toolbars}\label{sec:thetoolbars}

There are two \inlineglspluraldef{toolbar}.  The horizontal toolbar positioned at
the top of the main window, which allows you to manipulate
\glspl{object} on the \gls{canvas} (as well as the save, load and
new buttons) and the vertical toolbar positioned to the left of the
main window, which you can use to create new \glspl{path} and
\glspl{textarea}. If a toolbar is too wide\slash tall, scroll buttons will
appear.

You can show or hide the \gls{toolbar} or change the location of
the vertical toolbar so that it appears on the right of \FlowframTk's
main window using the \widget{borders.title} tab in the
\dialog{configui} dialog.

The \hyperref[sec:thepreamblepane]{preamble pane} has its own
toolbar with buttons to edit the preamble text.


\section{The Rulers}\label{sec:therulers}

There are two \inlineglspluraldef{ruler}.The horizontal ruler
positioned above the \gls{canvas} which marks out the $x$-ticks, and
the vertical ruler positioned to the left of the \gls*{canvas} which
marks out the $y$-ticks. The gap between tick marks can be changed
using the \menu{settings.grid.settings} menu item.

You can show or hide the \glspl*{ruler} using the menu item
\menu{settings.rulers}.  You can adjust their size and number format
using the \widget{borders.title} tab in the \dialog{configui}
dialog box. When the rulers are visible, the grid unit is displayed
in the corner between the rulers. You can \gls{doubleclick} on this
corner to open the grid settings dialog.

\section{The Status Bar}\label{sec:thestatusbar}

\FloatFig
  {fig:statusbar}
  {\includeimg{annoteStatusBar}}
  {The Status Bar}

The \inlineglsdef{statusbar} (\figureref{fig:statusbar}) is positioned along
the bottom of the main window. This has the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item The current position of the pointer (or the pointer's last
position before it was moved away from the \gls{canvas}). You can
\gls{doubleclick} on this area to open the \dialog{goto} dialog.

\item The \hyperref[sec:controlsettings]{storage unit}. You
can \gls{doubleclick} on this to open the storage unit selector.

\item The file status area.  If the current picture has been modified, it
will display the word \qt{\gls{info.modified}}, otherwise it
will be blank.

\item The \gridlock\ indicator. This shows if the \gridlock\ is on
\includeimg{key} or off \includeimg{keycross}. You can
\gls{doubleclick} on this area to toggle the \gridlock\ setting as an
alternative to using the \menu{settings.grid.lock} menu item or
button.

\item The current magnification. You can adjust this value by
\glslink{click}{clicking} on the plus or minus icons to move up or
down the pre-defined list of zoom settings. Alternatively, in the area
between them where the magnification value is displayed, you can
\gls{menuclick} to popup a~menu or \gls{doubleclick} to open the
\dialog{zoom} dialog.

\item A help button \includeimg{statushelp} that you can \gls{click} on
to open the manual at the section related to the current operation.
This button is only present when the current operation has a section
in the manual.

\item A brief message about the currently selected tool or
operation. If the message is too long to fit in the provided area,
you can \gls{doubleclick} on it to open a dialog window with the
full message (\figureref{fig:information}).

\end{itemize}

\FloatFig
  {fig:information}
  {\includeimg{informationDialog}}
  {The Information Dialog}

You can show or hide the \gls*{statusbar}, or elements within the
bar, using the \dialog{configui} dialog. You can also use this
dialog to change the font used in the \gls*{statusbar}.

\section{Common Dialog Buttons}\label{sec:commonwidgets}

Some menu items open dialog boxes. Many of them share some common
buttons.

\widgetdef{button.okay}

The \widget{okay} button applies the settings in the dialog and
closes the dialog window.

\widgetdef{button.cancel}

The \widget{cancel} button discards any changes that have been made
and closes the dialog window.

\widgetdef{button.default}

The \widget{button.default} button may be used to restore default
settings.

\widgetdef{button.choose}

The \widget{button.choose} button opens a new dialog in which you
can choose a sub-setting from the main dialog window.

\chapter{The File Menu}\label{sec:filemenu}

\menudef{menu.file}

You can use the \menu{file} menu to create a
\hyperref[sec:newimage]{new} picture,
\hyperref[sec:loadimage]{load} a picture from a
\gls{JDR} or \gls{AJR} file,
\hyperref[sec:saveimage]{save} the current picture,
\hyperref[sec:exportimage]{export} the current
picture to a supported format (such as a \LaTeX\ file),
\hyperref[sec:imagedescription]{assign a description} to the
current picture, \hyperref[sec:print]{print} the
current picture or \hyperref[sec:quit]{quit} \FlowframTk.

\section{New}\label{sec:newimage}

\menudef{menu.file.new}

To start a new picture, select \menu{file.new}. This will open
a new child window. You can switch between child windows using the
\menu{window} menu.

\section{Open}\label{sec:loadimage}

\menudef{menu.file.open}

To load a \gls{JDR} or \gls{AJR} file, select \menu{file.open}.
If there is already a picture in the current child window, a new
child window will open to display the file. Note that although
\FlowframTk\ can export to other formats, it can only load
\gls{JDR} and \gls{AJR} files. (Although there is an import option
available in the experimental mode.)

If you load an image that contains a link to a \gls{bitmap} and
the bitmap is no longer in the same location, you will be prompted
for a new link or you can discard the link. Note that if you
select a new link, the \LaTeX\ link will also be updated.
If there is insufficient memory in the \gls{jre} to load a bitmap,
\FlowframTk\ will revert to draft mode for that bitmap.

On some systems you may be able to \gls{drag-and-drop} \gls{JDR} or
\gls{AJR} files from a filer window onto \FlowframTk's internal desktop
(the \manmsg{grey} background of \FlowframTk's main window) and this
will load each file into \FlowframTk. If you drag and drop a
\gls{bitmap} it will be equivalent to \hyperref[sec:newimage]{creating a
new image} and then \hyperref[sec:insertbitmap]{inserting the bitmap}.

For example, in \figureref{fig:dnda} three \gls{JDR} files and
a PNG file have been selected and then dragged onto \FlowframTk's
desktop, \figureref{fig:dndb}. This results in four child
windows, \figureref{fig:dndc}, where one of them is a new
untitled image with the link to the \gls{bitmap} inserted.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:dnd}
{
  {fig:dnda}{\includeimg{dnd1}}{},
  {fig:dndb}{\includeimg{dnd2}}{},
  {fig:dndc}{\includeimg{dnd3}}{}
}
{Drag and Drop onto \FlowframTk's Internal Desktop}

If you want to open an image in a new child window using drag and drop,
make sure you drop onto \FlowframTk's desktop. If you drop a file onto a
text area, such as the preamble pane or the text field used to
create a new \gls{textarea} then the filename (or URI) will be
inserted instead. If you drop onto a \gls{canvas}, the file contents
will be added to the current image (in the case of a \gls{JDR} or
\gls{AJR} file) or a link will inserted into the current image (in the
case of a \gls{bitmap} file). You can only drop a file onto the
\gls{canvas} in \selectmode\ (and no objects are being distorted or
edited).

\section{Recent Files}\label{sec:recentfiles}

\menudef{menu.file.recent}

To load a recently used \gls{JDR} or \gls{AJR} file, use the sub
menu \menu{file.recent}. A maximum of ten files, starting with the
most recently used are listed. Note that loading a file from this
list will change the open file chooser directory to that file's
directory.

\section{Image Description}\label{sec:imagedescription}

\menudef{menu.file.image_description}

You can use the \menu{file.image_description} dialog box to give the
image a description. The description is not visible in the image,
but may be saved as a comment if you \filefn{export} the image. If you have the
\widget{clssettings.pdfinfo} option selected in the
\widget{clssettings.title} tab of the \dialog{texconfig} dialog box,
the image description will be added to an exported \LaTeX\ document
in the \gls{pdfinfo/Title} attribute of the \gls{pdfinfo} argument.

\section{Save and Save As}\label{sec:saveimage}

\menudef{menu.file.save}
\menudef{menu.file.save_as}

You can save the current picture in \FlowframTk's native
\gls{JDR} (binary) or \gls{AJR} (ASCII) format using either
\menu{file.save} (if it already has a name)
or \menu{file.save_as} (if you want to specify the
filename).  I strongly recommend that you save your work frequently.
There is no auto-save function. The \gls{JDR} format can store
higher precision values than the \gls{AJR} format.

\section{Export}\label{sec:exportimage}

\menudef{menu.file.export}

\begin{warning}
Note that \FlowframTk\ can't load the files that it can export, so I
strongly recommend that you first save the picture as a
\gls{JDR} or \gls{AJR} file before exporting it, in case you
wish to edit it later.
\end{warning}

The \menu{file.export} menu allows you to export your image. The
\inlineglsdef{export.title} dialog box provides a way to specify the name
and location of the file.  The file format for the exported file
depends on the selected file filter.  A default filename will be
provided with the same basename as the image (if it has one).

The \gls{filter.png} file filter (export to PNG) will ignore all
\LaTeX\ settings and render the image as \glslink{painting}{drawn}
on the \gls{canvas} (without annotations or \glspl{selection-bbox}).
The other formats all expect a \TeX\ distribution.

\subsection{Export to PNG}\label{sec:exportpng}

Select the \inlineglsdef{filter.png} file filter in the
\dialog{export} dialog box to export to a PNG file. This export type
ignores all \LaTeX\ settings. Once you have selected the destination
\inlineglsdef{ext.png} file, the \inlineglsdef{exportpng.title}
dialog box will open (see \figureref{fig:exportpngdialog}).

\FloatFig
  {fig:exportpngdialog}
  {\includeimg{exportpngdialog}}
  {Export to PNG Settings}

Select the \widget{exportpng.usealpha} box if you want a \gls{transparent}
background. If the box isn't checked, the background will be white.

Select the \widget{exportpng.crop} checkbox if you want the image cropped
to the image's \gls{image.bbox}. If the checkbox isn't checked, the image
will be the same size as the paper \gls{paper.size}. 

Note that all \manmsgpl{colour} will be converted to RGB.
The resulting PNG image won't include the grid or any annotations
but will otherwise render as the image shown on the \gls{canvas}.

\subsection{Export to a \LaTeX\ Class or Package}\label{sec:exportsty}

Select the \widget{filter.cls} file filter in the
\dialog{export} dialog box to export to a \LaTeX\ class
(\inlineglsdef{ext.cls}) or selected the \widget{filter.sty}
file filter to export to a \LaTeX\ package (\inlineglsdef{ext.sty}).

The class or package will require the \sty{flowfram} package to
create the page layout defined by the image through the functions in
the \menu{tex.flowframe} menu.  The \sty{pgf} package will also be
required to create borders and backgrounds, where applicable.

Only \glspl{object} that have been identified as static, flow or
dynamic frames will be exported (see \sectionref{sec:flowframe}).
This means that you can create additional \glspl{object} for use as
guidelines and they won't be included in the class or package.

The settings provided in the \dialog{textconfig} configuration
will be used. If exporting to a class, the provided class will be
used as a basis (using \gls{LoadClass}). The class setting is
ignored when exporting to a package.

The early-\hyperref[sec:preamble]{preamble text} is added before the
start of the package option declarations, which provides a means to
add extra package options, if required.  The mid-preamble text will
be placed after the class or packages are loaded and the
end-preamble text is placed at the end of the class or package.

\begin{important}
The \hyperref[sec:texconfigpreamble]{default preamble} is not used
when exporting to a class or package.
\end{important}

Any occurrences of \gls{usepackage} in the image
preamble will be converted to \gls{RequirePackage} on export.

\seealsorefs{sec:texconfig,
sec:preamble,
sec:flowframe,
sec:houseexample,
sec:neuronexample,
sec:postertutorial,
sec:newstutorial}

\subsection{Export to PGF}\label{sec:exportpgf}

Select the \widget{filter.pgf} file filter in the \dialog{export}
dialog box to export to a \LaTeX\ file that contains a
\env{pgfpicture} environment, which can then be included into a
\LaTeX\ document using \gls{input}.

The start of the file will include comments with
code between an \csfmt{iffalse} \ldots\ \csfmt{fi} block
that may be required in your preamble. If necessary, copy that block
into your document's preamble.

If you want to create a standalone file, complete with a document
class and document environment, you will need the
\nameref{sec:exportdoc} function instead.

\seealsorefs{sec:texconfig,
sec:preamble,
sec:houseexample,
sec:neuronexample}

\subsection{Export to Single-Paged Document}\label{sec:exportdoc}

To create a standalone \LaTeX\ document (\inlineglsdef{ext.tex}), select
the \widget{filter.pgfdoc} file filter, which will use the image's
paper \gls{paper.size}, or select the \widget{filter.pgfencapdoc} file filter to
set the page geometry to the image's \gls{image.bbox} (or \gls{image.typeblock}
if \widget{clssettings.use_typeblock_as_bbox} is set, see
\sectionref{sec:normalsize}).

\begin{information}
For the encapsulated export function,
if the bounding box is smaller than the baselineskip, the page
height is set to the baselineskip, according to the given
\hyperref[sec:normalsize]{normal size} for the image.
\end{information}

Alternatively, select the \widget{filter.pdf} file filter to create
a \inlineglsdef{ext.pdf} file.  This function works by first creating a
standalone encapsulated \LaTeX\ document in a temporary file and
then compiling it with \app{pdflatex}. The temporary file (and any
associated files created in the process) will then be deleted.

If a default preamble has been set (see
\sectionref{sec:texconfigpreamble}) the code will be included in the
\ext{tex} file's preamble.  This is in
addition to the contents of the image's early-, mid- and
late-\hyperref[sec:preamble]{preamble}. For example, I have set the
default preamble to:
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\end{verbatim}
If you prefer to use \sty{fontspec}, change the application path for
\app{pdflatex} to \app{lualatex}.

If your image includes \LaTeX\ commands that require a particular
package, you will need to add these packages to the
\hyperref[sec:preamble]{image preamble}. This is done automatically
by the \gls{textarea-mapping} function, if it has been
\hyperref[mi:texmappings]{enabled}.  See
\sectionsref{sec:texconfigtext,sec:preamble} for further details.

\FlowframTk\ will automatically add
\verb|\usepackage{pgf}| to the preamble and other packages such as
\sty{geometry} and \sty{ifpdf}. It will also add
\begin{verbatim}
\usepgflibrary{decorations.text}
\end{verbatim}
in case the image contains any \glspl{textpath}.

\begin{warning}
Changes caused by differences in the way that \FlowframTk\ renders
\glspl{textarea} with the way that \LaTeX\ typesets them
can cause the image to be clipped if the bounding box
has been underestimated. If this is a problem, you can switch on
the \widget{clssettings.use_typeblock_as_bbox}
option and use the \gls{image.typeblock} function to mark your
preferred bounding box.
\end{warning}

For example, in \figureref{fig:equation} I have a \gls{textarea} with the
alternative \LaTeX\ text set to:
\begin{verbatim}
$\displaystyle f(\boldsymbol{\Upupsilon}; \eta ) = 
\frac{1}{2}\eta \sum_k\boldsymbol{\upupsilon}_k\cdot 
\boldsymbol{\upupsilon}_k$
\end{verbatim}
Below this is a \gls{path} for illustrative purposes. When viewed in
\FlowframTk, as shown in \figureref{fig:equationa}, the
\gls*{textarea} and \gls*{path} are the same widths, but when the
image is exported to PDF, shown in \figureref{fig:equationb}, the
equation generated by the alternative text is wider that its
representation on the \gls{canvas} and has consequently been clipped
(both the top of the fraction and the right end of the equation)
because it exceeds the image bounding box that was computed by
\FlowframTk.

In \figureref{fig:equationc}, a rectangle has been
added to the image. This now extends the image bounding box, so when
the image is now exported to PDF, as shown in
\figureref{fig:equationd}, the equation is no longer clipped,
but the new rectangle is now visible, which may not be desirable.

There are two ways to deal with this. The first is to give the
rectangle a \gls{transparent} \pathattr{line-paint} (in addition to the
default \gls{transparent} \pathattr{fill-paint}) but now it can only been detected on the
\gls{canvas} when it's selected. The second method is to set the
\gls{image.typeblock} to the area of that rectangle (see \sectionref{sec:typeblock}).
The easiest way to do this is to \select\ the rectangle, use the
\menu{tex.flowframe.set_typeblock} menu item to open the
\dialog{typeblock} dialog box, and click on the
\widget{typeblock.compute_from_path} button. Then delete the
rectangle. The \gls{image.typeblock} is now shown as a \manmsg{grey} rectangle in
\figureref{fig:equatione}. Now make sure that the
\widget{clssettings.use_typeblock_as_bbox}
setting is on. Redoing the export to PDF now
produces the image shown in \figureref{fig:equationf}.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:equation}
{
 {fig:equationa}{\includeimg{equationa}}{},
 {fig:equationb}{\includeimg{equationb}}{},
 {fig:equationc}{\includeimg{equationc}}{},
 {fig:equationd}{\includeimg{equationd}}{},
 {fig:equatione}{\includeimg{equatione}}{},
 {fig:equationf}{\includeimg{equationf}}{}
}
[Exported Text Areas Can Overflow Bounding Box]
{Exported Text Areas Can Overflow Bounding Box:
\subfigref{fig:equationa} image as shown on canvas;
\subfigref{fig:equationb} image exported to PDF (equation has been clipped);
\subfigref{fig:equationc} rectangle added to image;
\subfigref{fig:equationd} image from \subfigref{fig:equationc} exported to PDF;
\subfigref{fig:equatione} typeblock added and rectangle removed;
\subfigref{fig:equationf} image from \subfigref{fig:equatione} exported to PDF.}

If the exported PDF file has unexpected results or fails to be
created, try exporting to an encapsulated \LaTeX\ document and then
manually building the document, as the issue may be due to the
conversion process or it may be due to an unrecognised command or
syntax error in a \gls{textarea} or \gls{textpath}.

\seealsorefs{sec:texconfig,sec:preamble,sec:fontanchor}

\subsection{Export to SVG or EPS}\label{sec:exportsvgeps}

The export to SVG or EPS functions both work in the same way
as \hyperref[sec:exportdoc]{exporting to an encapsulating PDF}
in that a temporary encapsulated \LaTeX\ file is first created.

If the \widget{filter.svg} file filter is chosen, then the temporary
file will be compiled with \app{latex} followed by
\app{dvisvgm} to created an  \inlineglsdef{ext.svg} file.

If the \widget{filter.eps} file filter is chosen, then the temporary
file will be compiled with \app{latex} followed by
\app{dvips} to created an \inlineglsdef{ext.eps} file.

In either case, if the image contains any
\glspl{bitmap}, \FlowframTk\ will attempt to convert
them to EPS, where necessary.

\begin{important}
Note that PostScript does not support transparency.
\end{important}

As with the export to encapsulated PDF, if the resulting SVG or EPS
file has unexpected results or fails to be created, try exporting to
an encapsulated \LaTeX\ document and then manually building the
document.

\section{Page Setup}\label{sec:pagesetup}

\menudef{menu.file.page}

The \menu{file.page} menu item will open the printer's page
setup dialog box. This will require a print service to be available.
The \glspl{printer-margin} will be shown on the \gls{canvas} if the
\menu{settings.paper.margins} menu item is selected.

\section{Print}\label{sec:print}

\menudef{menu.file.print}

You can \glslink{printing}{print} the current image using the \menu{file.print} menu
item which will open the printer dialog box. If no printer is found,
the error message \qt{\errmsg{printing.no_service}} will
be displayed. If this happens, check that the printer is switched
on and connected to the computer. The print function uses the
\gls{canvas}['s] \gls{rendering} and \gls{anti-aliasing} settings
(provided in the \dialog{graphics} configuration) and draws
the image as it's displayed on the \gls{canvas} (at 100\%
magnification and without the grid or annotations).

\begin{information}
If you use the printer's \qt{Print to PDF} function (where
supported), the resulting PDF may be different from that created
with the export to PDF function (see \sectionref{sec:exportdoc})
as the \LaTeX-related settings won't be used by the printer.
\end{information}

\section{Message Window}\label{sec:messages}

\menudef{menu.file.messages}

You can display the \inlineglsdef{message.title} window using the
\menu{file.messages} item. This usually just lists the
files that have been opened, saved or exported, but warnings are
sometimes written there as well. This window is opened during a read
or write operation. When an external application is spawned, the
abort button becomes enabled, which you can use to kill the spawned
process if required.

\section{Close}\label{sec:closeimage}

\menudef{menu.file.close}

You can close the current child window, either by clicking on the
child window's close icon or by selecting \menu{file.close}.
If there is any unsaved data, \FlowframTk\ will ask for confirmation
before discarding the window (see \figureref{fig:confirmclose1}).
In this dialog box you can:

\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\includeimg{discard}}

\begin{itemdesc}
click on the discard button next to the image name to discard the
image;
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\includeimg{save}}

\begin{itemdesc}
click on the save button next to the image name to save the image;
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\includeimg{cancel}}

\begin{itemdesc}
click on the cancel button at the bottom of the dialog box to cancel
the close operation.
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

\FloatFig
  {fig:confirmclose1}
  {\includeimg{confirmclose1}}
  {Confirm Discard Dialog (1 Modified Image).}

An image will only be marked as unmodified if it has been saved as a
\gls{JDR} or \gls{AJR} file.  If you have
\hyperref[sec:exportimage]{exported} your image to another file
type, I recommend that you also \hyperref[sec:saveimage]{save} it as
a \gls{JDR} file as well, in case you want to edit it later.

Note that you must finish or discard any \gls{path} that is under
\hyperref[sec:newobjects]{construction} before you can close
an image.

\section{Quit}\label{sec:quit}

\menudef{menu.file.quit}

To quit \FlowframTk\ either use the menu item
\menu{file.quit} or click on the close icon on the
main window. All child frames will be closed. If any child frame
contains unsaved data, you will be asked for confirmation before
the window is discard. If there is only one modified image, the
dialog box is as for the \hyperref[sec:closeimage]{close operation} shown in
\figureref{fig:confirmclose1}, otherwise it's as shown in
\figureref{fig:confirmclose2}, where each modified file is listed.

\FloatFig
  {fig:confirmclose2}
  {\includeimg{confirmclose2}}
  {Confirm Discard Dialog (2 Modified Images).}

As with the close operation, for each listed file, you can:
\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\includeimg{save}}

\begin{itemdesc}
click on the save button next to the image name to save the image;
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\includeimg{discard}}

\begin{itemdesc}
click on the discard button next to the image name to discard the
image.
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

Alternatively you can:
\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\includeimg{save_all}}

\begin{itemdesc}
click on the save all button to save all the listed files;
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\includeimg{discard_all}}

\begin{itemdesc}
click on the discard all button to discard all the listed files and
quit;
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\includeimg{cancel}}

\begin{itemdesc}
click on the cancel button at the bottom of the dialog box to cancel
the quit operation.
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

\chapter{Creating New Objects}\label{sec:newobjects}

\menudef{menu.tools}

New \glspl{path} and \glspl{textarea} can be created using
\FlowframTk's \gls{construction}, which can be obtained using any tool
except the \tool{select}. The tools can be selected using either the
vertical \gls{toolbar} or the \menu{tools} menu. Once \glspl{path}
and \glspl{textarea} have been created they can then be edited or
transformed or combined to form a \gls{textpath} object. You can
also apply patterns to \glspl{path} or \glspl{textpath}.

\Glspl{bitmap} (\sectionref{sec:insertbitmap}) can also be added to
the image but this is done via the \menu{bitmap.insert} menu item
and they can't be edited (although they can be moved, scaled,
sheared and rotated).

\menudef{menu.tools.finish}

Finish the \gls{path} or \gls{textarea} by pressing
\accelerator{menu.tools.finish} or by selecting \menu{tools.finish}
or by clicking on the finish button or (\gls{path}) by
\glslink{doubleclick}{double-clicking} (instead of single-clicking)
on the final vertex or (\gls{textarea}) clicking on the \gls{canvas}
where you want the next \gls{textarea} to start.  

Note that transferring the focus to
another \FlowframTk\ child window or selecting a new tool whilst you
are constructing a \gls{path}, will complete the current path.

\menudef{menu.tools.abandon}

Cancel the current \gls{path} by pressing the
\accelerator{menu.tools.abandon} key or by selecting
\menu{tools.abandon} or by clicking on the abandon path button.
(Not applicable for \glspl{textarea}.)

\menudef{menu.tools.gap}

The \inlineglsdef{gap} or \qt{\gls{move-to}} function is only
available when constructing an open or closed
\hyperref[sec:newlinepath]{line path} or \hyperref[sec:newcurvepath]{curve
path}.  Once you have clicked on the vertex where you want the
\gls{gap} to start, select \menu{tools.gap} or click on the
\gls{gap} button or press \accelerator{menu.tools.gap}, then click
on the \gls{canvas} where you want the \gls{gap} to end. The next
segment will resume according to the tool (line or curve).

\begin{warning}
The undo/redo mechanism is disabled while you are constructing a
path, however while you are creating a line path or a curve path,
you can delete the previous segment using the
backspace \accelerator{action.delete_last} key.
\end{warning}

Note that \FlowframTk\ won't allow you to create a \gls{path} whose
total width and height are both less than 1.002\gls{bp}. This is to
prevent accidentally creating a tiny path that can't be seen but
contributes to the total image dimensions. This restriction only
applies when creating \glspl*{path} and does not apply to editing
paths.

The \dglspl{path-attribute} will only be set
once the \gls{path} has been completed. Whilst the
\gls{path} is under construction you will
only see a draft version (see \figureref{fig:draftfinal}).
If you want a \gls{path} with a mixture of line and curve
segments, first construct a \gls{path} with only one
type of segment (e.g.\ lines), and then use the
\gls{menu.edit.path.edit} function to convert
the required segments.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:draftfinal}

 {fig:draftfinala}{\includeimg{underconstruction}}{},
 {fig:draftfinalb}{\includeimg{curvecompleted}}{}
}
[Path Attributes Are Only Set Once the Path is Completed]
{Path attributes are only set once the path is completed:
\subfigref{fig:draftfinala} path under construction;
\subfigref{fig:draftfinalb} path completed.}

If you are unable to use the mouse, you can move the pointer using
\menu{navigate.goto}. The keystroke
\accelerator{action.construct_click} will emulate a single mouse
click in \gls{construction}.

\seealsorefs{sec:editpath,sec:symmetric,sec:patterns}

\section{Line Paths}\label{sec:newlinepath}

\menudef{menu.tools.open_line}

To construct an open line \gls{path}, select the open line tool,
either by clicking on the open line button or by selecting
\menu{tools.open_line}. You can later close the \gls{path}
with the \gls{menu.edit.path.edit} function.

\menudef{menu.tools.closed_line}

To construct a closed line \gls{path}, select the closed line tool,
either by clicking on the closed line button or by selecting
\menu{tools.closed_line}. You can later open the \gls{path}
with the \gls{menu.edit.path.edit} function.

Use the \glslink{primaryclick}{primary mouse button} to click on each vertex
defining the path. To complete the \gls{path}, do one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \glslink{doubleclick}{Double-click} instead of single-clicking
on the final vertex: this performs the combined function of defining
the vertex and finishing the path. If you use this method, be
careful not to accidentally create two coincident vertices at the
end point, or it will cause a problem for any mid or end
\hyperref[sec:markers]{marker} that you apply.

\item Single-\gls{click} on the final vertex and then
complete the path by pressing \accelerator{tools.finish} or by
clicking on the finish button or by selecting
\menu{tools.finish}.
\end{itemize}
If you have used the closed line tool, the path will automatically
be closed by inserting a line between the end vertex
and the initial vertex.

\section{Curve Paths}\label{sec:newcurvepath}

\menudef{menu.tools.open_curve}

To construct an open curve \gls{path}, select the open curve tool,
either by clicking on the open curve button or by selecting
\menu{tools.open_curve}. You can later close the \gls{path}
with the \gls{menu.edit.path.edit} function.

\menudef{menu.tools.closed_curve}

To construct a closed curve \gls{path}, select the closed curve tool,
either by clicking on the closed curve button or by selecting
\menu{tools.closed_curve}. You can later open the \gls{path}
with the \gls{menu.edit.path.edit} function.

Use the \glslink{primaryclick}{primary mouse button} to click on each vertex in
the \gls*{path}.  There is no way to specify the location of the
\glspl{controlpt} defining the curvature of the \gls*{path} whilst the
\gls*{path} is under construction, however, once the
\gls*{path} has been completed, it is possible to move these
\glspl*{controlpt} in \editpathmode.

To complete the \gls*{path}, do one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \glslink{doubleclick}{Double-click} instead of single-clicking
on the final vertex: this performs the combined function of defining
the vertex and finishing the path. If you use this method, be
careful not to accidentally create two coincident vertices at the
end point, or it will cause a problem for any mid or end
\hyperref[sec:markers]{marker} that you apply.

\item Single-\gls{click} on the final vertex and then
complete the path by pressing \accelerator{tools.finish} or by
clicking on the finish button or by selecting
\menu{tools.finish}.
\end{itemize}
If you have used the closed curve tool, the path will automatically
be closed by inserting a curve between the end vertex
and the initial vertex.

\section{Rectangles}\label{sec:rectangles}

\menudef{menu.tools.rectangle}

To construct a rectangle, select the rectangle tool either by
clicking on the rectangle tool button or by selecting
\menu{tools.rectangle}.

Use the \glslink{primaryclick}{primary mouse button} to click where
you want the first corner to go, then move (not drag) the mouse to
the opposite corner, and \gls{click} or press
\accelerator{menu.tools.finish} to complete the \gls{path}.

Note that this function is just a shortcut to using the
\gls{menu.tools.closed_line} function. Once the rectangle is
created, it is simply another closed \gls{path}, and can be edited in
exactly the same way.

\section{Ellipses}\label{sec:ellipses}

\menudef{menu.tools.ellipse}

To construct an ellipse, select the ellipse tool either by clicking
on the ellipse tool button or by selecting
\menu{tools.ellipse}.

Use the \glslink{primaryclick}{primary mouse button} to click on the
\manmsg{centre} point of the ellipse, and then move (not drag) the mouse
until the ellipse has reached the desired dimension, and \gls{click}
or press \accelerator{menu.tools.finish} to complete the \gls{path}. If you want
to create a circle, I recommend that you first enable the \gridlock\ or use the
\menu{navigate.goto} menu item.

Note that this function is just a shortcut to using the
\gls{menu.tools.closed_curve} function. Once the ellipse is
created, it is simply another closed \gls{path}, and can be edited in
exactly the same way.

\section{Text}\label{sec:newtext}

\Glspl{textarea} can be created to annotate images. Each
\gls*{textarea} has text that's displayed on the \gls{canvas} but
may have alternative text to use when
\hyperref[sec:exportimage]{exporting} to a \LaTeX\ file. (This includes
the export functions that create a temporary \LaTeX\ file, such as
the export to PDF function.) There are two tools to create a
\gls*{textarea}: the \texttool\ and the \mathstool. These
affect the default alternative text for the new \gls*{textarea} in
different ways. You can later \hyperref[sec:edittext]{edit the
alternative text}, if the default isn't suitable.

Line breaks are not supported in \gls{textarea}. If you are using
the \hyperref[sec:flowframe]{flowframe} functions, you can create a
static frame and provide multi-lined text for the frame content.

\menudef{menu.tools.textarea}

The text tool can be selected either by clicking on the
\gls{menu.tools.textarea} tool button or by selecting \menu{tools.textarea}.

If \widget{textconfig.escape} is enabled, the alternative text will be set
to the original supplied text with any identified characters
substituted according to the \widget{textconfig.textmode} settings.

\menudef{menu.tools.math}

The \manmsg{maths} tool can be selected either by clicking on the
\gls{menu.tools.math} tool button or by selecting \menu{tools.math}.

If \widget{textconfig.escape.mathchar} is enabled, the alternative text will be set
to the original supplied text with any identified characters
substituted according to the \widget{textconfig.textmode} settings.

After any substitutions on the alternative have been performed, 
the \gls{mshift} character will be added to the start and end
of the alternative text.


With either the \texttool\ or the \mathstool,
once you have selected the required tool, click with the
\glslink{primaryclick}{primary mouse button} at the position where
you want the text to start. This will produce a shaded area with a
cursor in which you can type no more than a single line of text
(\figureref{fig:textareafield}).
Clicking inside this shaded area will move the cursor around the
text area under construction.

  {Text Area Construction Field}

When you want to complete a \gls{textarea}, press
\accelerator{menu.tools.finish} (which will start a new
\gls{textarea} on the line below) or click anywhere on the canvas
outside of the current text area (which will start a new
\gls{textarea} at the new location) or use the
\gls{menu.tools.finish} button or \menu{tools.finish}.  Selecting
another tool whilst a \gls{textarea} is under construction will
finish the current \gls{textarea}, unless you're switching between
the \texttool\ and \mathstool.  (If you do switch between the
text and \manmsg{maths} tools, the alternative \LaTeX\ text is only
created when you finish the \gls*{textarea}, so the mappings applied
will be governed by the tool currently selected when you completed
the \gls*{textarea}.) An empty \gls{textarea} will be discarded.

If a mapping is performed that has an associated package, then the
package will be automatically add to the image's
\hyperref[sec:preamble]{early-preamble}. The mapping function will
first search the early-preamble code to check if the package is
already present, but it doesn't check the mid- or late-preamble code
or the code in the \hyperref[sec:texconfigpreamble]{default
preamble}.

Once a \gls{textarea} has been completed, the only way to edit it is via the
\hyperref[sec:edittext]{edit text function}. If you click the
mouse on the location of a completed text area (while the
\texttool\ or \mathstool\ is selected) you will simply create a new
overlapping \gls*{textarea}.

If your operating system supports \gls{drag-and-drop}, you can also
\gls{drag-and-drop} text onto the \gls{canvas}. If the drop point is
inside the \gls{textarea} construction field, the dropped text will
be inserted into the field (newline characters will be converted to
spaces). If the drop point is outside the \gls{textarea}
construction field, a new text area will be created for each line of
dropped text. The mapping applied to the dropped text will be
according to the currently selected text tool.  If text is dropped
onto the \gls{canvas} in \selectmode, the text mappings (not
\manmsg{maths} mappings) will be applied. If a file is dropped onto
the \gls{canvas} when either the \texttool\ or \mathstool\ is
active, the file path (or URI) will be added as a new
\gls{textarea}.

\figureref{fig:dndtext} illustrates \gls{drag-and-drop} to create new
\glspl{textarea}.
In \figureref{fig:dndtexta} I have four lines of
text selected in a text editor. The second line simply contains two
space characters (which aren't visible). These four lines of text
are then dragged onto the \gls{canvas},
\figureref{fig:dndtextb}, and dropped. The drop location (the
location of the pointer when the mouse button was released) is
directly on the canvas, not on the \gls{textarea} construction field (which
currently isn't visible). This creates three new \glspl*{textarea},
\figureref{fig:dndtextc}.
The line solely consisting of white space hasn't created a 
\gls{textarea} but has contributed to the vertical offset of the following
\gls{textarea}. In \figureref{fig:dndtextd}, the same three lines of
text are dragged onto the \gls{textarea} construction field and dropped
at the cursor, \figureref{fig:dndtexte}. This has inserted the
dropped text into the \gls{textarea} construction field. The new line
characters have been converted to spaces and the \gls{textarea}
construction field is awaiting further input.

\menudef{index.menu.textarea}

Whilst a \gls{textarea} is under construction, you can activate the
\gls{index.menu.textarea}, illustrated in
\figureref{fig:textpopup}, with a \gls{menuclick}. Alternatively,
you can use the \accelerator{popup} key or, if supported by your
system, the \accelerator{context_menu} \gls{context-menu} key.

\FloatFig

\menudef{menu.textarea.copy}

The \menu{textarea.copy} menu item copies to the clipboard any text within 
the text construction field that has been selected.

\menudef{menu.textarea.cut}

The \menu{textarea.cut} menu item cuts to the clipboard any text within 
the text construction field that has been selected.

\menudef{menu.textarea.paste}

The \menu{textarea.paste} menu item pastes text from the
clipboard to the cursor position in the text construction field.

\menudef{menu.textarea.select_all}

The \menu{textarea.select_all} menu item selects all text in 
the text construction field.

\menudef{menu.textarea.insert_symbol}

The \menu{textarea.insert_symbol} menu item 
opens the \dialog{symbolselector} dialog  if you want to
enter a symbol that doesn't appear on your keyboard. 

\plabel[Insert Symbol Dialog Box]{mi:insertsymbol}% HelpSet id
\widgetdef{symbolselector.title}

\FloatFig
  {fig:insertsymbol}
  {\includeimg[width=\linewidth]{annoteInsertSymbol}}
  {Insert Symbol Dialog Box}

The \dialog{symbolselector} dialog box (see \figureref{fig:insertsymbol})
has a field at the top which contains the text currently in the text
area. If you know the hexadecimal Unicode value for the character
you want to insert, you can type the number into the
\widget{symbolselector.unicode} box and press the
\includeimg{insertAtCaret} \widget{symbolselector.insertAtCaret} button to
insert it into the text field at the caret. 

On the right hand panel below the \widget{symbolselector.unicode} field
there is an enlarged image of the selected character. If there's an
associated mapping it will be displayed below the image
(see \figureref{fig:insertsymbol}), but remember that this mapping
may change if you switch between the \texttool\ and \mathstool\ before
completing the \gls{textarea}.

Alternatively, you can use the button panels on the left to
select the character you want to insert into the text field. Use the
left hand list to display the require Unicode block and either click
on the button with the required character on it to insert and
display the symbol or hold the shift key down while you click to
just display the symbol in the right hand panel without inserting it
into the text field. The available Unicode blocks and symbols are govern by the
\widget{lang.title} tab in the \dialog{configui} dialog.

Once the \gls{textarea} has been finished (by clicking on the
\gls{menu.tools.finish} button or by pressing
\accelerator{menu.tools.finish} or by switching to a non-text
tool) any packages that are required by the mappings will be added
to the \hyperref[sec:preamble]{early-preamble pane}, as shown in
\figureref{fig:addpackage}.  Note that the \gls{canvas} and the
preamble panes have separate undo\slash redo managers so if you undo
a new text area it will remove the new text area but won't remove
the modification to the preamble. You will need to switch to the
early-preamble panel and use its undo button or \gls{popupmenu} item.

\section{Bitmaps}\label{sec:insertbitmap}

\menudef{menu.bitmap}

\FlowframTk\ is primarily a \gls{vectorgraphics} application,
however it is possible to insert a \maingls{bitmap}
(\gls{rastergraphics}) into your picture for background effects or
if you want to annotate a \gls{bitmap} (as was done in
\figureref{fig:insertsymbol}).  Note that
\FlowframTk\ does not save the actual \glslink{rastergraphics}{raster} data in either
the \gls{JDR} or the \gls{AJR} file, but instead it creates a reference
to the original file. You can't edit the actual bitmap data in
\FlowframTk. However you can scale, rotate or shear the link
using the \gls{affine-transformation} functions described in 
\sectionref{sec:affinetrans} or by directly editing the
bitmap's \gls{bitmap.transformation-matrix}. 

\begin{important}
If you change the location of the file containing the bitmap, when
\FlowframTk\ reloads the \gls*{JDR} or \gls*{AJR} file it will
prompt you to either provide the new location or discard the reference.
\end{important}

\menudef{menu.bitmap.insert}

To insert a \gls{bitmap} into your picture, first make sure you are using
the \tool{select} (and no shapes are
being edited or distorted), and then select the menu item
\menu{bitmap.insert} and a file selector dialog box will appear in which
you can choose the required \gls{bitmap}. The \gls{bitmap} will initially appear
in the top left hand corner of the \gls{canvas} but can be
\hyperref[sec:moveobjects]{moved} to a new location.  If your
operating system supports \gls{drag-and-drop}, you can also drag a
\gls{bitmap} file onto the \gls{canvas} (in \selectmode) and it will
be inserted at the drop location.

If there is insufficient memory in the \gls{jre} to load a bitmap,
\FlowframTk\ will revert to draft mode to display that bitmap.  For
example, in \figureref{fig:draftbitmap} several photos have been
inserted into an image. Since photos tend to be quite large, there
is insufficient memory to load the final photo, so it is displayed
in draft mode instead. Note that draft mode will also be used when
printing or when \hyperref[sec:exportpng]{exporting to PNG}. Since \LaTeX\ files
only contain a link to the bitmap, draft mode should not affect
exporting to \LaTeX\ files or to formats that use \app{latex} or
\app{pdflatex} as an intermediate step.

Note that the amount of memory available to any Java application is
set at startup. The default maximum value can be changed via the
\gls{jre} command line options.  If you run \FlowframTk\ from the
shell script \app{flowframtk}, then you can set the environment
variable \gls{JDR_JVMOPTS} to change the default configuration. See
\sectionref{sec:cmdargs} for further details. If you are running
\FlowframTk\ from Windows, you will need to check the \gls*{jre}
documentation.

\FloatFig
  {fig:draftbitmap}
  {\includeimg{draftBitmap}}
  [Bitmaps Are Displayed in Draft Mode When There is Insufficient Memory in the JRE]
  {Bitmaps are displayed in draft mode
when there is insufficient memory in the \gls{jre}. The area taken up by
the image is displayed as a semi-transparent light \manmsg{grey} rectangle
with the bitmap's file name in square brackets.}

\menudef{menu.bitmap.refresh}

If you use another application to edit the bitmap whilst
you have a picture with a link to it displayed in \FlowframTk, you will
need to select \menu{bitmap.refresh} to update the image.

\menudef{menu.bitmap.properties}

The \menu{bitmap.properties} menu item will open the 
\dialog{bitmap_properties} dialog (see \sectionref{sec:bitmapprops}).

\menudef{menu.bitmap.vectorize}

The \menu{bitmap.vectorize} function is an experimental
feature. It's only available if \app{flowframtk} is invoked with
the \switch{experimental} switch.

Currently undocumented and may be removed.

\subsection{Properties}\label{sec:bitmapprops}

\widgetdef{bitmap_properties.title}

To change a \gls{bitmap}['s] properties (file reference, alternative
\LaTeX\ path, or \gls{bitmap.transformation-matrix}), \select\
the required \gls{bitmap} and select the \menu{bitmap.properties}
menu item. This will open up the \dialog{bitmap_properties} dialog box shown in
\figureref{fig:bitmapprops}. If you want to change the path name to
the bitmap, you can either type it directly into the
\widget{label.filename} field or click on the
\widget{browsebitmap.browse} button.

You can also use the \dialog{bitmap_properties} dialog to change the
\gls{bitmap.transformation-matrix} applied to the bitmap link.
If you want to reset the \gls{bitmap.transformation-matrix}, it's
quicker to use the \menu{transform.reset} menu item.

\FloatFig
 {fig:bitmapprops}
 {\includeimg{bitmapprops}}
 {Bitmap Properties Dialog}

If you want to \filefn{export} your picture to a \LaTeX\ file or
to a format that uses \app{latex} or \app{pdflatex} as an intermediate
step, the \LaTeX\ command can either be \gls{pgfimage} or
\gls{includegraphics} and is specified in the
\widget{bitmap_properties.command} field. The command argument in
either case must use a \gls{forwardslash} as the directory divider. If
the \widget{bitmap_properties.auto_latexfilename} \gls*{checkbox}
is selected, this substitution will be performed automatically by
the export function. Alternatively, you can unselect
the \widget{bitmap_properties.auto_latexfilename} \gls*{checkbox}
which will enable the
\widget{bitmap_properties.latexfilename} field in which you
can enter the argument to be used by the image command. If you use the
export to PostScript or \gls{svg} function, \FlowframTk\ will
attempt to create an EPS version of the bitmap (if it doesn't
already exist) since \app{latex} (as opposed to
\app{pdflatex}) can't include bitmap formats, such as PNG and
JPEG.

\seealsorefs{sec:bitmapconfig}

\subsection{Vectorizing}\label{sec:vectorize}

The \menu{bitmap.vectorize} function is an experimental
feature. It's only available if \FlowframTk\ is invoked with
the \switch{experimental} switch.

Currently undocumented and may be removed.


\chapter{Selecting, Navigation and Basic Editing}\label{sec:selectobjects}

\menudef{menu.tools.select}

In order to edit an \gls{object}, you must be in \selectmode. To do
this either click on the \gls{menu.tools.select} button or use the 
\menu{tools.select} menu item. An \gls*{object} can
be selected using any of the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item Click on it with the \glslink{primaryclick}{primary mouse button}.

\item \Gls{doubleclick} the primary mouse button to
select the \gls*{object} \glslink{backobject}{behind} the current \gls*{object}.

\item Use \keyref{ctrl}-click (that is, \gls{click} whilst holding down the control
\keys{\keyref{ctrl}} key) if you want to add an \gls*{object} to the current
selection.

\item \Gls{click} on an empty part of the \gls{canvas} and
drag. A dashed rectangle will appear. When you release the mouse
button, any \glspl*{object} within that
region will be selected. (If you have the shift \keys{\keyref{shift}} key depressed,
only those objects which are completely inside the dashed
rectangle will be selected, but make sure you release the mouse
button before releasing the shift key.)

\item Use the \menu{navigate} menu (see \sectionref{sec:navigate}).

\end{itemize}

\menudef{menu.edit.select_all}

The \menu{edit.select_all} menu item will select all
\glspl{object}.

\menudef{menu.edit.deselect_all}

The \menu{edit.deselect_all} menu item will deselect all
\glspl{object}. You can also click on
an empty part of the \gls{canvas} to deselect all \glspl{object}.
Selecting another tool will also deselect all \glspl*{object}.

\begin{information}
To deselect an individual \gls*{object}, click on that object whilst
depressing the shift \keys{\keyref{shift}} key.
\end{information}

When an \gls{object} is selected, a dashed red\slash\manmsg{grey}
rectangle will be displayed around it. This rectangle is the 
\emph{\inlineglsdef{selection-bbox}} and may optionally have
\gls{hotspot} regions. Note that individual elements of a
\gls{group} can not be selected independently of the group.  When
you select a group, you will only see a dashed
red\slash\manmsg{grey} rectangle around the \gls{bbox} of the group,
not around the individual elements of the group.

In \selectmode\ you can \gls{drag-and-drop} \gls{JDR} or \gls{AJR}
files onto the \gls{canvas} (provided your operating system supports
drag and drop) which will add all the objects from those files to
the current image. The new objects will be added to the current
selection. You can't drag and drop if a shape is being edited or
distorted.

If text is dropped onto the \gls{canvas} in \selectmode, the text
mappings (not \manmsg{maths} mappings) will be applied. If a file is
dropped onto the \gls{canvas} in \textmode\ or \mathsmode, instead of
in \selectmode, the file path (or URI) will be added as a new \gls{textarea}.

\section{Selection Popup Menus}
\label{sec:selectpopups}

In \selectmode, you can also \gls{menuclick} to activate the
selection \gls{popupmenu}. The contents of this menu vary according to
what types of \glspl*{object} have been \selected, if any.

  {Popup Menu when a Text-Path is Selected}


If a text-path has been selected then the
\gls{index.menu.selectedtextpath} is very similar to the
\gls{index.menu.selectedtext} but additionally has the
\menu{selectedpath.edit} menu item to switch on edit mode for the
underlying path.

% BITMAP POPUP

\menudef{index.menu.selectedbitmap}

\FloatFig
  {fig:selectpopups.bitmap}
  {\includeimg{selectPopupBitmap}}
  {Popup Menu when only Bitmaps are Selected}

In addition to the \gls{index.menu.selected},
if a \gls{bitmap} is selected then the following options will be available
(\figureref{fig:selectpopups.bitmap}).

\menudef{menu.selectedbitmap.properties}

To edit the \gls{bitmap}['s] properties, use
\menu{selectedbitmap.properties}. This is the same as using
the \menu{bitmap.properties} menu item from the main menu bar.
This option won't be available if there is more than one
\gls{bitmap} selected.

\menudef{menu.selectedbitmap.reset}

To reset the \gls{bitmap}['s]
transformation matrix, use \menu{selectedbitmap.reset}. This is the
same as using the \menu{transform.reset} menu item from the main menu
bar.

\menudef{menu.selectedbitmap.insert}

To insert another \gls{bitmap}, use \menu{selectedbitmap.insert}. This is the
same as using the \menu{bitmap.insert} menu item from the main menu
bar.

% GROUPS OR MIXTURE

\menudef{index.menu.selectedgroup}

\FloatFig
  {fig:selectpopups.other}
  {\includeimg{selectPopupOther}}
  {Popup Menu when Groups or Mixture are Selected}

In addition to the \gls{index.menu.selected},
if any \glspl{group} or mixture of \glspl{object} are selected 
then following option will be available
(\figureref{fig:selectpopups.other}).

\menudef{menu.selected.ungroup}

To ungroup any selected \glspl{group}, use
\menu{selected.ungroup}. This is the same as using the
\menu{transform.ungroup} menu item from the main menu bar.
This option won't be available if there are no
\glspl{group} selected.

\menudef{menu.selected.path}

If any \glspl{path} have been selected or if any selected
\glspl{group} contain any \glspl{path}, then the
\menu{selected.path} sub menu will be available. This has the same
menu items as \gls{index.menu.selectedpath}.

\menudef{menu.selected.textarea}

If any \glspl{textarea} have been selected or if any selected
\glspl{group} contain any \glspl{textarea}, then the
\menu{selected.textarea} sub menu will be available. This has the same
menu items as \gls{index.menu.selectedtext}.

\menudef{menu.selected.fill_colour}

If any \glspl{path} have been selected or if any \glspl*{textarea}
have been selected with \textattr{outline} mode on, then the
\menu{selected.fill_colour} menu item will be available. This is the
same as using the \menu{edit.fill_colour} menu item from the main
menu bar.

\menudef{menu.selected.bitmap}

The \menu{selected.bitmap} sub menu has the same
menu items as \gls{index.menu.selectedbitmap}.

\menudef{menu.selected.justify}

To justify the contents of any selected \glspl{group}, use the
\menu{selected.justify} sub menu. This is the same as using the
\menu{transform.justify} sub menu from the main menu bar.
This option won't be available if there are no
\glspl{group} selected.


\section{Navigation Menu}\label{sec:navigate}

\menudef{menu.navigate}

The \menu{navigate} menu provides a way to navigate around the
\gls{canvas} and can help to \select\ \glspl{object}
in a cluttered image.

\menudef{menu.navigate.goto}

The \menu{navigate.goto} menu item opens the
\inlineglsdef{goto.title} dialog (\figureref{fig:goto}).  Enter the
$x$ and $y$ co-ordinates in the \widget{coordinates.x} and
\widget{coordinates.y} fields if you are using a rectangular grid,
or enter the angle and radius in the \widget{coordinates.angle} and
\widget{coordinates.radius} fields, if you are using a radial grid.

\FloatFig
  {fig:goto}
  {\includeimg{goto}}
  {Go To Co-ordinate Dialog Box}

If your system allows applications to move the cursor
(via the \gls{robot}), the cursor will be moved to the entered
co-ordinates (scrolling the \gls{canvas} if necessary).

\menudef{menu.navigate.select}

The \menu{navigate.select} menu item 
\selects\ the next \gls{object} in the \gls{stack}. (Starting from the
\gls{front} and heading towards the \gls{back}.) This will cycle back to
the start when it reaches the end of the \gls{stack}.

\menudef{menu.navigate.skip}

The \menu{navigate.skip} menu item will deselect the
selected \gls{object} closest to the \gls{back}, and \select\
the next \gls{object} in the \gls{stack} (heading towards the \gls{back}). This
will cycle back to the start when it reaches the end of the stack.
If you have more than one \gls{object} selected, the remaining
\glspl*{object} will stay selected.

\menudef{menu.navigate.add_next}

The \menu{navigate.add_next} menu item will add
the next \gls{object} in the \gls{stack} to the selection (starting from
the \gls{front} and heading towards the \gls{back}). This will cycle back to
the start when it reaches the end of the stack.

\menudef{menu.navigate.find}

If an \gls{object} is already \selected, the \menu{navigate.find}
menu item will scroll the \gls{canvas} to ensure the \gls{object} is
in the viewport. If your system allows applications to move the
cursor (via the \gls{robot}), the cursor will be moved to the top left corner of the
\gls{object}['s] bounding box.

\menudef{menu.navigate.by_description}

The \menu{navigate.by_description} menu item will open the
\inlineglsdef{description.title} dialog box. This has all the \glspl{object}
listed by their description.  If a description hasn't been set, a
generic description is used.  Select the required description and
click \btn{okay} to select the corresponding \gls{object} (and
deselect any currently selected \gls{object}).

\menudef{menu.navigate.add_description}

The \menu{navigate.add_description} menu item is similar to 
\menu{navigate.by_description} but will select the \gls{object}
without deselecting any other \glspl{object} that are already
selected.

\section{Moving an Object Up or Down the Stacking Order}\label{sec:moveupordown}

\Glspl{object} are \glslink{drawing-on-canvas}{painted} on the
\gls{canvas} according to the
\maingls{stackingorder}. This means that objects can
partially or wholly obscure other objects in the same location.
The first object to be \glslink{drawing-on-canvas}{painted}
is the \maingls{backobject} (behind any other object in the same
location) and the last object to be \glslink{drawing-on-canvas}{painted}
is the \maingls{frontobject}.

For example, in \figureref{fig:stackingordera} the green rectangle is
at the bottom (\gls{back}) of the stack ($z=0$), the blue circle is in
the middle of the stack ($z=1$) and the yellow triangle is at the
top (\gls{front}) of the stack ($z=2$). The stacking order has
been reversed in \figureref{fig:stackingorderb}, with the green
rectangle now at the top (front) of the stack ($z=2$) and
the yellow triangle now at the bottom (back) of the stack
($z=0$).

\FloatSubFigs{fig:stackingorder}
{
  {fig:stackingordera}{\includeimg{stackingordera}}{},
  {fig:stackingorderb}{\includeimg{stackingorderb}}{}
}
{Stacking Order}

If \glspl{object} don't overlap or if they don't have a
\gls{index.fill-colour}, the \gls{stackingorder} may not be
immediately apparent, but the order is important when you're
defining frames for the \sty{flowfram} package. You can cycle the
selection in reverse order from front to back of the stack using the
\menu{navigate.select} menu item.

\menudef{menu.edit.front}

Each new \gls{object} is automatically added to the \gls{front} when it is
created, but \glspl{object} can also be moved to the \gls{front} 
with the \menu{edit.front} menu item.

\menudef{menu.edit.back}

A selected \gls{object} can be moved to the
\gls{back} of the \gls{stack} (so that other \glspl{object} in the
same location obscure it) with the \menu{edit.back} menu item.

\menudef{menu.edit.moveup}

An object can be moved up the \gls{stackingorder} using
the \menu{edit.moveup} menu item.

\menudef{menu.edit.movedown}

An object can be moved down the \gls{stackingorder} using
the \menu{edit.movedown} menu item.


\section{Grouping and Ungrouping Objects}\label{sec:grouping}

A \gls{group} is a collection of \glspl{object} that are treated as
though they are a single entity. When you select a \gls{group}, you
will only see the \gls{bbox} of the entire group, not the
\glspl*{bbox} of each individual object within the group. If a
\gls{group} is \hyperref[sec:rotateobjects]{rotated},
\hyperref[sec:scaleobjects]{scaled} or \hyperref[sec:shearobjects]{sheared}, each
\gls*{object} within the group will maintain its relative position.
Objects within a \gls{group} may also be
\hyperref[sec:alignobjects]{aligned}.  Note that a \gls{group} can
not be edited. Grouping and ungrouping \glspl*{object} may change
the \gls{stackingorder}.

\menudef{menu.transform.group}

To group \glspl*{object}, first \select\
all the objects you want in the \gls{group}, and then select the
\menu{transform.group} menu item.

\menudef{menu.transform.ungroup}

To \inlineglsdef{ungroup} a group, first \select\ the
group, and then select the \menu{transform.ungroup} menu item. Note
that this function is not recursive: if a group contains other
groups when you ungroup the outer group, the inner groups will
remain.  Any description assigned to a group will be lost when it's
ungrouped.

\begin{warning}
Note that if you ungroup an \gls*{object} containing
\hyperref[sec:flowframe]{flowframe} related
data, the \gls{flowframe} information will be lost. If you group objects
containing flowframe data, and then assign that group flowframe data,
any flowframe data assigned to the contents of that group will be
removed.

\section{Aligning Objects}\label{sec:alignobjects}

\menudef{menu.transform.justify}

It is only possible to align \glspl{object} that form part of a
\gls{group}. Objects within a group can be aligned vertically or
horizontally using the \menu{transform.justify} sub menu.

Note that alignment is not recursive: if a group contains another
group, the contents of the sub group will not be aligned, each
element in the sub group will be moved by the same amount.

\menudef{menu.transform.justify.left}

The \menu{transform.justify.left} menu item will move all objects
within the \gls{group} so that the left edge of each object's \gls{bbox}
lies along the left edge of the group's \gls*{bbox}.  (See
\figureref{fig:alignex1b}.)

\menudef{menu.transform.justify.centre}

The \menu{transform.justify.centre} menu item will move all objects
within the \gls{group} so that they are \manmsg{centred} horizontally
within the group's \gls*{bbox}.  (See \figureref{fig:alignex1c}.)

\menudef{menu.transform.justify.right}

The \menu{transform.justify.right} menu item will move all objects
within the \gls{group} so that the right edge of each object's \gls*{bbox}
lies along the right edge of the group's \gls*{bbox}.  (See
\figureref{fig:alignex1d}.)

\menudef{menu.transform.justify.top}

The \menu{transform.justify.top} menu item will move all objects
within the \gls{group} so that the top of each object's \gls*{bbox} lies along the
top of the group's \gls*{bbox}.

\menudef{menu.transform.justify.middle}

The \menu{transform.justify.middle} menu item will move all objects
within the \gls{group} so that they are \manmsg{centred} vertically
within the group's \gls{bbox}.

\menudef{menu.transform.justify.bottom}

The \menu{transform.justify.bottom} menu item will move all objects
within the \gls{group} so that the bottom of each object's \gls*{bbox} lies
along the bottom of the group's \gls*{bbox}.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:alignex1}
{
  {fig:alignex1a}{\includeimg{alignex1a}}{},
  {fig:alignex1b}{\includeimg{alignex1b}}{},
  {fig:alignex1c}{\includeimg{alignex1c}}{},

}
[Aligning a Group Consisting of Three Objects]
{Aligning a group consisting of three objects: 
\subfigref{fig:alignex1a} original; 
\subfigref{fig:alignex1b} left justified; 
\subfigref{fig:alignex1c} \manmsg{centre} justified; 
\subfigref{fig:alignex1d} right justified.}

If the \widget{textconfig.anchor} \gls{checkbox} in the
\hyperref[sec:texconfig]{TeX Configuration Settings Dialog} is
selected, any \glspl{textarea} that are contained in a group that is
justified will automatically have their \textattrpl{anchor} changed.
For example, in \figureref{fig:alignex1} one of the objects is a
\gls*{textarea}.  If the auto anchor update facility is enabled, the
\gls*{textarea} in \figureref{fig:alignex1b} will have its
horizontal \textattr{anchor} changed to \widget{font.anchor.left},
in \figureref{fig:alignex1c} it will have its horizontal
\textattr{anchor} changed to \widget{font.anchor.hcentre} and in
\figureref{fig:alignex1d} it will have its horizontal
\textattr{anchor} changed to \widget{font.anchor.right}. Similarly,
applying a vertical alignment will change the vertical
\textattr{anchor} to one of: \widget{font.anchor.top},
\widget{font.anchor.vcentre} or \widget{font.anchor.bottom}.

\begin{information}
Note that there is no way of aligning \glspl{textarea} along their
baseline. (However it is possible that the baseline may coincide
with the bottom of the \gls*{textarea} if the \gls*{textarea} doesn't contain
any characters with descenders.)
\end{information}

\strong{Tip:} Sometimes you might want to \manmsg{centre} an
\gls{object} relative to another thinner object. In this case it's
better to create a \hyperref[sec:rectangles]{rectangle}
\manmsg{centred} on the thin object that encompasses all the objects
you want to justify.  Include this rectangle in the \gls{group},
justify, ungroup and then delete the rectangle. For example, the
image shown in \figureref{fig:alignex2a} has a \gls{textarea} below
the middle line. It would look better if the text was
\manmsg{centred} below the line, so I grouped the middle line and
\gls{textarea} and justified them using
\menu{transform.justify.centre}. The result is shown in
\figureref{fig:alignex2b}. Although the \gls{textarea} and line are
now \manmsg{centred} relative to each other, the line was moved to
the \manmsg{centre} of the \gls{textarea}, not the other way round.
This was not what was intended. Instead, in
\figureref{fig:alignex2c}, I created a new rectangle that is
\manmsg{centred} on the line. Since the line is on a tick mark and
the grid lock is on, it is relatively easy to create this rectangle
(much easier than trying to move the \gls{textarea} to manually
align it). I then grouped the rectangle, the middle line and the
text area and justified them using \menu{transform.justify.centre}.
The result is shown in \figureref{fig:alignex2d}. The justified
objects were then ungrouped and the rectangle was deleted to
produced \figureref{fig:alignex2e}.

\section{Cut}\label{sec:cutobjects}

\menudef{menu.edit.cut}

To cut a \selection\ of \glspl{object} to the
clipboard, use \menu{edit.cut} menu item. Note that it will be stored
on the clipboard as a \code{JDRGroup} Java object, not as text or
\gls{rastergraphics}, so you won't be able to paste it into a different
application.  If you want to cut a piece of text
from a \gls{textarea}, you will need to use the
\hyperref[sec:edittext]{edit text area} function.
Note that the \hyperref[sec:preamble]{preamble panes} have
their own cut button.

\section{Copy}\label{sec:copyobjects}

\menudef{menu.edit.copy}

To copy a \selection\ of \glspl{object} to the
clipboard, use \menu{edit.copy}. Note that it will be stored
on the clipboard as a \code{JDRGroup} Java object, not as text or
\gls{rastergraphics}, so you won't be able to paste it into a different
application.  If you want to copy a piece of text from a
\gls{textarea}, you will need to use the
\hyperref[sec:edittext]{edit text area} function.
Note that the \hyperref[sec:preamble]{preamble panes} have
their own copy button.

\section{Paste}\label{sec:pasteobjects}

\menudef{menu.edit.paste}

To paste a \selection\ of \glspl{object} from the clipboard, use
\menu{edit.paste}. If you want to copy text from another
application, and paste it into a \gls{textarea} in \FlowframTk, you
will have to \hyperref[sec:newtext]{create a new text area}, and
use the \gls{index.menu.textarea} to paste the text into the
\gls*{textarea}.  If you want to paste plain text into an existing
\gls*{textarea}, you will need to use the
\hyperref[sec:edittext]{edit text area} function.  Note that the
\hyperref[sec:preamble]{preamble panes} have their own paste button.

\section{Object Description}\label{sec:objectdescription}

\menudef{menu.edit.object_description}

You can assign a description to a \selected\ \gls*{object} using the
\menu{edit.object_description} menu item. This will display the
dialog box shown in \figureref{fig:objectDescription}. Type the
description into the text field, and click on \btn{okay} or press
\keys{\keyref{return}}.  Note that the \gls{menu.edit.object_description}
menu item is only available if exactly one object is \selected.

\FloatFig
  {fig:objectDescription}
  {\includeimg{objectDescription}}
  {Setting an Object's Description}

The description will not appear in the image, but it can be used to
locate and select \glspl*{object} on the canvas using the
\menu{navigate.by_description} or
\menu{navigate.add_description} menu items. The description
may also be used as a comment when
\hyperref[sec:exportimage]{exporting images}, depending on the
file type.

\begin{important}
If you assign a description to a \gls{group},
you will lose the description if you later ungroup it.
\end{important}

\chapter{Paint (\Glsentrytext{manual.colour} and Shading)}
\label{sec:paintcolourandshading}

\Inlineglsdef{index.paint} is the \inlineglsdef{index.colour} or
\inlineglsdef{index.gradient-paint} (shading) used for
\dglspl{text-colour}, \dglspl{line-colour} and \dglspl{fill-colour}. When selecting a
\dgls{paint} for a particular attribute, you may have a choice of:
\glsname{transparent}, a \dgls{paint.solid-colour} or a \dgls{gradient-paint}.
(Some attributes, such as marker \gls{index.marker.colour},
only support a \gls{index.paint.solid-colour}.)

\section{Paint Selector}\label{sec:paint}

\widgetdef{colour.title}

The \widget{colour.title} panel is used in various \gls{index.paint}
selection dialog boxes.
In most cases, the \widget{colour.single} option is the default
(such as the \pathattr{line-paint}).  However, the
\pathattr{fill-paint} defaults to \widget{colour.transparent}.
Where only a \gls{index.paint.solid-colour} is supported, the radio
buttons will be omitted and only the \widget{colour.single} panel
will be available.

\begin{warning}
The \dglspl{colour} you see on the screen may not exactly match
\dglspl{colour} produced by your printer due to the non-invertible
mapping between \dgls{colour} spaces.
\end{warning}

\widgetdef{colour.transparent}

Selecting the \widget{colour.transparent} radio button indicates
\inlineglsdef{transparent}. For example, if a \pathattr{line-paint} is set to
\widget{colour.transparent} then this indicates that the \gls{shape}
outline should not be \glslink{drawing-on-canvas}{drawn} or if a
\pathattr{fill-paint} is set to \widget{colour.transparent} then
this indicates that the \gls{shape} should not be filled.

If you require \gls{translucency} (where there is some \dgls{paint}
but \glspl{object} behind show \manmsg{through}) then select one of
the other \dgls{paint} options and adjust the alpha channel.

\widgetdef{colour.single}

\FloatFig{fig:paint-solid}
{\includeimg{paint-solid}}
{Solid \Manmsg{colour} Selector}

Selecting the \widget{colour.single} radio button indicates a
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.solid} \dgls{colour} and enables the
\widget{colour.single} panel (see \figureref{fig:paint-solid}). 

A \dgls{paint.solid-colour} may be expressed as
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.rgb} (red, green, blue),
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.cmyk} (cyan, magenta, yellow, black),
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.hsb} (hue, saturation, brightness) or
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.greyscale}. In each case,
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.transparency} may be added by adjusting
the alpha channel.  If the alpha value is 100\% then the
\dgls{colour} is opaque.  Smaller values increase
\gls{translucency}, allowing \glspl{object} behind to show
\manmsg{through}.

The parameters are specified as integer values between 0 and 100,
or between 0 and 359 in the case of hue.
You can type in the number in the appropriate box, or use
the slider bars. Alternatively, you can click on one of the predefined swatches
which are to the right of the \widget{colour.single} panel 
and can be used to quickly set a \manmsg{colour}. Click on the 
appropriate swatch and the \manmsg{colour} specification will be
filled in.

\widgetdef{colour.gradient}

\FloatFig{fig:paint-linear-gradient}
{\includeimg{paint-linear-gradient}}
{Gradient Paint Selector (Linear Selected)}

Selecting the \widget{colour.gradient} radio button indicates a 
\inlineglsdef{index.gradient-paint} and enables the
\widget{colour.gradient} panel (see
\figureref{fig:paint-linear-gradient}). 

A \gls{index.gradient-paint} is a shading that smoothly transitions
from a \inlineglsdef{index.gradient-paint.start-colour} to an
\inlineglsdef{index.gradient-paint.end-colour}.  There is a choice
of \gls{index.gradient-paint.linear} or
\gls{index.gradient-paint.radial}. Both are a shading that
transitions from one \dgls{colour} (the
\inlineglsdef{index.gradient-paint.start-colour}) to another (the
\inlineglsdef{index.gradient-paint.end-colour}).  The
\inlineglsdef{colour.start} and \inlineglsdef{colour.end} selectors
each have the same interface as the \widget{colour.single} panel.

{
 {fig:linearshading}{\includeimg{linear-shading}}{Linear},
 {fig:radialshading}{\includeimg{radial-shading}}{Radial}
}
{Gradient Shading}

\widgetdef{colour.linear}

A \inlineglsdef{index.gradient-paint.linear} shading transitions in
a band from the \gls{index.gradient-paint.start-colour} to the
\gls{index.gradient-paint.end-colour} in the given direction. There
are eight directions which are enabled when the
\widget{colour.linear} radio button is selected: North, North-East,
East, South-East, South, South-West, West, and North-West.  The
direction buttons can either be clicked on or selected with the
keystrokes \keys{\keyref{alt}+\actualkey{1}} \ldots\
\keys{\keyref{alt}+\actualkey{8}}.

For example, \figureref{fig:linearshading} has a solid black
\pathattr{line-paint} but the \pathattr{fill-paint} is a linear
gradient paint from yellow to magenta. The direction is set to North
so the bottom of the shape is yellow and the shading transitions to
magenta at the top of the shape.

\widgetdef{colour.radial}

A \inlineglsdef{index.gradient-paint.radial} shading radiates
outwards from a starting location. There are nine locations which
become enabled with the \widget{colour.radial} radio button is
selected. These are arranged in a three by three grid referencing
regions of a \gls*{shape}['s] \gls{bbox}.
The location buttons can either be clicked on or
selected with the keystrokes \keys{\keyref{alt}+\actualkey{1}} \ldots\
\keys{\keyref{alt}+\actualkey{9}} (starting from the bottom left).

For example, \figureref{fig:radialshading} has a solid black
\pathattr{line-paint} but the \pathattr{fill-paint} is a radial
gradient paint from yellow to magenta. The location is set to the
middle bottom location. So the middle bottom area of the \gls{shape}
is yellow but the transition to magenta radiates outwards from there
in all directions (clipped by the shape).

\section{\Glsentrytext{manual.colour} Space Conversions}\label{sec:convertcolspace}

\menudef{menu.edit.adjustcol}

\FlowframTk\ supports the
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.rgb} (red, green, blue),
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.cmyk} (cyan, magenta, yellow, black),
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.hsb} (hue, saturation, brightness) and
\gls{index.colour.greyscale} \manmsg{colour} spaces.

\Glspl{index.line-colour}, \glspl{index.fill-colour} and
\glspl{index.text-colour} can be converted to a different
\manmsg{colour} space.

\menudef{menu.edit.adjustcol.togrey}

\Glspl{index.line-colour}, \glspl{index.fill-colour} and
\glspl{index.text-colour} can be reduced to
\inlineglsdef{index.colour.greyscale} using
\menu{edit.adjustcol.togrey}.  Only selected \glspl{path} and
\glspl{textarea} will be affected. If you want to reduce a
\gls{bitmap} to \gls{index.colour.greyscale} you will need to use a
bitmap editor.

\menudef{menu.edit.adjustcol.rgb}

The \menu{edit.adjustcol.rgb} menu item will convert to
\gls{index.colour.rgb}.

\menudef{menu.edit.adjustcol.cmyk}

The \menu{edit.adjustcol.cmyk} menu item will convert to
\gls{index.colour.cmyk}.

\begin{warning}
Note that \manmsg{colour} space conversions are not exact. You may
not end up with the desired effect. Some \filefn{export} functions
may not support the chosen \manmsg{colour} space and may convert
during the export process.

using the \menu{edit.adjustcol.fade} menu item. Only selected

\section{Removing Translucency}\label{sec:removetrans}

\menudef{menu.edit.adjustcol.removetrans}

\Glspl{index.line-colour}, \glspl{index.fill-colour} and
\glspl{index.text-colour} can have the \gls{translucency} removed using
the \menu{edit.adjustcol.removetrans} menu item. Only selected
\glspl{shape} and \glspl{textarea} will be affected. This function
sets the paint to none (completely \gls{transparent}) if the alpha value
is less than 0.5 otherwise it sets the alpha value to 1 (opaque).
For example, \figureref{fig:removetransa} shows three shapes: a
filled rectangle with alpha set to 100\%, a blue filled circle with
alpha set to 60\% and a yellow filled circle with alpha set to 40\%.
In \figureref{fig:removetransb}, the circles have had their
translucency removed. The blue filled circle now has the alpha set
to 100\% but the other circle, which formerly had a yellow interior,
has had its \gls{index.fill-colour} removed.

\chapter{Text}\label{sec:text}

\Glspl{textarea} consist of a single line of text. Alternative
\LaTeX\ code may be provided to use instead when the image
is \hyperref[sec:exportimage]{exported} to a \TeX-related format.
New \glspl{textarea} can be created with the
\texttool\ or \mathstool, as described in \sectionref{sec:newtext}.
An existing \gls{textarea} can be edited (\sectionref{sec:edittext}),
converted to a \gls{textpath} (\sectionref{sec:textpath}), or
converted to an \textattr{outline} (\sectionref{sec:textoutline}).

To change text style attributes (font and \textattr{anchor}) see
\sectionref{sec:textstyle}.

\section{Editing Text Areas}\label{sec:edittext}

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.edit}

To insert or delete characters from a \gls{textarea} or \gls{textpath} first
\select\ the \gls*{textarea} or \gls*{textpath}, and then
select the \menu{edit.textarea.edit} menu item.  (Note
that you should not have any other \glspl{object} selected.) This
will display the \inlineglsdef{edittext.title} dialog box
(\figureref{fig:edittexta}) in which you can modify the text as
appropriate. If you are editing the text of a \gls{textpath}, there
will be an extra panel visible, shown in
\figureref{fig:edittextb}.

\begin{information}
You can not edit a \gls*{textarea} or \gls*{textpath} if
it belongs to a \gls{group}. Deleting all the characters within a
\gls*{textarea} or \gls*{textpath} isn't permitted and will result
in the error message \qt{\errmsg{empty_string}}.
\end{information}

\FloatSubFigs{fig:edittext}

  {fig:edittexta}{\includeimg{editText}}{},
  {fig:edittextb}{\includeimg{editTextPath}}{}
}
[Edit Text Dialog Box]
{Edit Text Dialog Box: \subfigref{fig:edittexta} regular text area;
\subfigref{fig:edittextb} text-path}

The \gls{index.menu.textarea} is available in the top text field.
It has the same items as for the text input field used when a \gls{textarea}
is under construction.

If you want to specify alternative text to appear in a \LaTeX\
document, click on the button marked \widget{edittext.different},
and enter the alternative in the bottom field (see
\figureref{fig:edittextb}). The \gls{index.menu.textarea} is not
available in this field, but you can still use
\accelerator{menu.textarea.select_all},
\accelerator{menu.textarea.copy}, \accelerator{menu.textarea.cut}
and \accelerator{menu.textarea.paste} to select all the text, copy
to the clipboard, cut to the clipboard or paste from the clipboard,
respectively. Note that the \hyperref[sec:exportpgf]{exported} text
may occupy a larger or smaller area in the \LaTeX\ document than it
does in \FlowframTk, so you may also need to change the
\textattr{anchor} or set the image \glspl{image.typeblock}
(see \sectionref{sec:exportdoc}).

You can use the \widget{edittext.remap} button to generate
the alternative text in the bottom field by applying
\glspl{textarea-mapping} to the text in the top field (see
\sectionref{sec:texconfigtext}). If
the original alternative text starts and ends with a \gls{mshift}
symbol, the \mathsmode\ mappings will be used, otherwise the
\textmode\ mappings will be used. If the original alternative text is
empty, you can just type a \glssymbol{mshift} symbol in it and click on the
\widget{edittext.remap} button to generate a \mathsmode\
mapping. The original alternative text will be completely replaced by the text
from the top field with the appropriate mappings applied. You can
then edit this if necessary.

\widgetdef{edittext.textpath}

The \LaTeX-related \filefn{export} functions use the \sty{pgf} text
decoration to implement \glspl*{textpath}. This allows you to insert
declarations, such as \csfmt{large}, part way through the text by
placing them between \glspl{pgf.delimiter}. By default these delimiters are the
vertical bar (pipe) character \glssymbol{pipe} but this can be changed in
the \widget{edittext.textpath.left_delim} and
\widget{edittext.textpath.right_delim} fields (see
\figureref{fig:edittextb}). Note that the vertical \textattr{anchor}
setting is ignored by the \LaTeX\ export functions. It's best to avoid
\manmsg{maths} in \glspl{textpath}. See the \sty{pgf} manual for
further details about text decorations.

\begin{important}
The alternative text may not be used by \filefn{export} functions if
the \gls*{textpath} has been made an \textattr{outline} or if the
\gls*{textarea}\slash\gls*{textpath} has a gradient paint.
The export \manmsg{behaviour} under those circumstances is dependent on
the \hyperref[sec:texconfigtext]{\LaTeX\ text settings}.
The alternative text is not used when exporting to PNG or when
\gls{printing}.

\section{Text Transformation Matrix}\label{sec:textmatrix}

You can scale, rotate or shear text
using the \gls{affine-transformation} functions described in 
\sectionref{sec:affinetrans} or by directly editing the
\inlineglsdef{index.text-attribute.transformation-matrix}.

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.matrix}

The \menu{edit.textarea.matrix} menu item will open the \dialog{settransform}
dialog.
Note that if you want to reset a \textattr{transformation-matrix}, 
it's quicker to use \menu{transform.reset}.

\widgetdef{settransform.title}

The \dialog{settransform} dialog has six editable fields in which
you can edit the scaling, shearing and translation elements of the
\textattr{transformation-matrix}.

The \textattr{transformation-matrix} for a \gls*{textarea} is
applied relative to the top left corner of the \gls{canvas}. The
transformation matrix for a \gls{textpath} is applied relative to
the point along the underlying path where each character should be
positioned.

Once a \gls*{textarea} has been combined with a \gls{path} to form a
\gls{textpath}, the text can only be transformed by editing the
transformation matrix.  For example, \figureref{fig:textmatrix}
shows a \gls*{textpath} in edit mode (so that you can see the
underlying path) with different values of the transformation matrix.
In \figureref{fig:textmatrixa}, the transformation matrix is
set to the identity matrix, shown in
\figureref{fig:textmatrixb}.  In
\figureref{fig:textmatrixc}, the transformation matrix is set
as shown in \figureref{fig:textmatrixd}, (the vertical
translation has been set to 10, which is in terms of the
\gls{storageunit}). The text is no longer flush against
the path. In \figureref{fig:textmatrixe}, the transformation
matrix has been set as shown in \figureref{fig:textmatrixf},
(the horizontal shear element has been set to $-1$).

\section{Combining a Text Area and Path to Form a Text-Path}\label{sec:textpath}

\menudef{menu.transform.textpath}

A \gls{textarea} and a \gls{path} can be combined to form a
\gls{textpath}. Ensure that only a single \gls{textarea} and a
single \gls{path} are selected and use the \menu{transform.textpath}
menu item. The text from the original \gls{textarea} will then follow
the shape of the original path (which will now be the underlying
path).

The underlying path will not be visible (except in \editpathmode).
If the original \gls*{textarea} was in \textattr{outline} mode, the new
\gls*{textpath} will also be in \textattr{outline} mode, possibly with a 
\textattr{fill-paint}, depending on the original \gls*{textarea} and \gls*{path}
fill paint. (If the original \gls*{textarea} didn't have a
\textattr{fill-paint}, the \gls*{path} \pathattr{fill-paint} will be applied.)

The horizontal \textattr{anchor} determines
whether the text should start at the first \gls{controlpt} of the
underlying path or if it should be \manmsg{centred} along the path or if
it should be right aligned at the end \gls*{controlpt}. The vertical
\textattr{anchor} determines whether the base, bottom, top or middle of the
text should be aligned on the path. 

\begin{important}
The vertical \textattr{anchor} isn't implemented by the
\filefn{export} \TeX-related filters. Note that if the text is
longer than the path, the text will be truncated.
\end{important}

For example, the \gls{textarea} and \gls{path} in
\figureref{fig:textpatha} are combined to form a \gls*{textpath}.
The original \gls*{textarea}['s] horizontal \textattr{anchor} was
set to left, so the text along the path starts at the first
\gls{controlpt} in \figureref{fig:textpathb}. In
\figureref{fig:textpathc} the horizontal \textattr{anchor} has been
changed to \manmsg{centre}, and in \figureref{fig:textpathc} the
horizontal \textattr{anchor} has been changed to right.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:textpath}
{
 {fig:textpatha}{\includeimg{textandpath}}{},
 {fig:textpathb}{\includeimg{textpathleft}}{},
 {fig:textpathc}{\includeimg{textpathcentre}}{},
 {fig:textpathd}{\includeimg{textpathright}}{}
}
[Combining a Text Area and Path to Form a Text-Path]
{Combining a \gls{textarea} and \gls{path} to form a \gls{textpath}:
\subfigref{fig:textpatha} the original \gls{textarea} and \gls{path};
\subfigref{fig:textpathb} the resulting \gls{textpath} with left horizontal 
\textattr{anchor}; 
\subfigref{fig:textpathc} \manmsg{centred} \textattr{anchor}; 
\subfigref{fig:textpathd} right \textattr{anchor}. 
(The \glspl{textpath} are in edit mode to show the underlying path.)}

Once a \gls{path} has been combined with a \gls{textarea}, the line
style \glspl{index.path-attribute} are lost as the path is only used
as a guide to position the text. The \gls{cag} functions, such as
\transformfn{union}, are applied to the underlying path and the text
is adjusted to follow the new path.  Transformations using the
\transformfn{rotate}, \transformfn{scale} and \transformfn{shear}
functions are applied to the underlying path not the text. You can
either transform the text using the transformation functions before
combining it with a path or transform it after combining by changing
the text \textattr{transformation-matrix}.

Note there is a difference between applying \gls{symmetry} to a
\gls{textpath} and converting a \gls*{textarea} and
\gls{symmetricshape} to a \gls*{textpath}. For example, consider the
\gls{textarea} and \gls{path} in \figureref{fig:textpathsyma}. If
you first combine them to form a \gls*{textpath}
(\figureref{fig:textpathsymb}) and then add symmetry
(\figureref{fig:textpathsymc}), the result is a \gls*{textpath}
where the text is reflected across the \gls{line-of-symmetry}.
Conversely, applying \gls{symmetry} to the path first
(\figureref{fig:textpathsymd}) and then combining with the
\gls*{textarea} yields a \gls*{textarea} where only the underlying
path has \gls{symmetry} (\figureref{fig:textpathsyme}).

A similar effect applies with other types of \glspl{compositeshape}.

\begin{warning}
Restrictions apply to \glspl*{textpath} with the
\filefn{export} \TeX-related filters as some \gls*{textpath}
effects aren't emulated in \LaTeX, such as the vertical \textattr{anchor},
\gls{index.gradient-paint} and \textattrpl{outline}. You can determine 
the \manmsg{behaviour} on export via the \dialog{texconfig} dialog.

\section{Text Outlines}\label{sec:textoutline}

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.outline}

A \gls{textarea} or \gls{textpath} can be rendered as an
\inlineglsdef{index.text-attribute.outline} by
selecting it and then using the \menu{edit.textarea.outline}
menu item. For example, \figureref{fig:textoutlinea} shows a
standard \gls*{textarea} and \figureref{fig:textoutlineb} shows
that \gls*{textarea} rendered as an outline. If the outline mode is
set, you can apply a \gls{index.fill-colour} using
\menu{edit.fill_colour}.

\begin{warning}
Note that although \glspl*{textpath} can be rendered with an outline in \FlowframTk,
the \LaTeX\ \filefn{export} functions can't emulate
this and will either export the \gls*{textpath} without the outline
setting or will export it as a path (in which case the alternative
text will be ignored) depending on your
\hyperref[sec:texconfig]{\TeX\ Configuration Setting}.
\end{warning}

This is used to create the outlined effect. If you 
\hyperref[sec:exportpgf]{export} to a file containing \sty{pgf}
code to be input by another document, you will need to inspect the 
created \ext{tex} file for further information.

\section{Splitting Text Areas}\label{sec:splittext}

\menudef{menu.transform.split}

A \gls{textarea} or \gls{textpath} can be split into a \gls{group}
containing \glspl{textarea} each consisting of a single character.
The original alternative \LaTeX\ text will be lost. (No mappings
will be used.) First \select\ the required \glspl{textarea} or
\glspl{textpath} (no other type of \gls{object} should be selected)
and then use the \menu{transform.split} menu item.

For example, in \figureref{fig:splitex1a} there is a single 
\gls{textarea} containing the seven characters that make up the word
\qt{Rainbow}.  This text area was then converted into a group of
seven \glspl*{textarea} using \menu{transform.split}. The group was
then \hyperref[sec:grouping]{ungrouped} (see \figureref{fig:splitex1b}) 
and each \gls{textarea} was then given a different
\gls{index.text-colour} resulting in the image
shown in \figureref{fig:splitex1c}.

\FloatSubFigs*{fig:splitex1}
{
  {fig:splitex1a}{\includeimg{splitex1a}}{},

Note that if you split a \gls*{textpath}, you will lose the

\chapter{Affine Transformations}\label{sec:affinetrans}

\FlowframTk\ provides functions to perform 
\inlineglsdef{affine-transformation} on \glspl{object}:
\affinetrans{translation} (\sectionref{sec:moveobjects}), 
\affinetrans{rotation} (\sectionref{sec:rotateobjects}), 
\affinetrans{scaling} (\sectionref{sec:scaleobjects}) and 
\affinetrans{shearing} (\sectionref{sec:shearobjects}).

\Glspl{shape} may also be modified using other functions
that are not available for certain other types of \gls{object}. Those
functions are described in \sectionref{sec:modshape}.

\section{Moving an Object}\label{sec:moveobjects}

To move an \gls{object} or \glspl*{object}, first \select\ the
\glspl*{object} you want to move and then depress the
\glslink{primaryclick}{primary mouse button} somewhere inside the
selection, and drag the mouse.  Release the mouse button when the
\glspl*{object} have reached their required location.

\begin{important}
If the \gridlock\ is on, the \selected\
\gls{object} (or \glspl{object}) will move
in increments of the minor tick distance.
\end{important}

If you only want to move the object by a very small amount, and your
mouse is very sensitive or you have difficulties with fine motor
co-ordination, depress the mouse button and instead of dragging use
the arrow keys to move the pointer. (This will require the
\gls{robot} to be available.)

\menudef{menu.edit.moveby}

An alternative if you need to move a small amount or if you need to
move by an exact amount is to use the \menu{edit.moveby} menu item.
This will open the \dialog{moveby} dialog box (\figureref{fig:moveby}).
In the field marked \widget{coordinates.x} enter the horizontal
displacement, and in the field marked \widget{coordinates.y}
enter the vertical (\strong{downward}) displacement. For example, to move the
selected \glspl*{object} 10 units to the right and 20 units down,
type 10 in the \widget{coordinates.x} field and 20 in the
\widget{coordinates.y} field. To move left or up, use a negative
value.

\begin{information}
The \menu{edit.moveby} function is unaffected by the \gridlock.

\section{Rotating Objects}\label{sec:rotateobjects}

\menudef{menu.transform.rotate}

Selected \glspl{object} can be rotated with the
\menu{transform.rotate} menu item. This will display a dialog box in
which you can specify the angle of rotation.

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Individual \glspl{object}
will be rotated relative to the \manmsg{centre} of the \gls{object}.

\item \Glspl*{object} within a
\gls{group} will be rotated relative to the \manmsg{centre} of the
group.

\item Rotating a \gls{textpath} will rotate the path and the text
will adjust to follow the transformed path.

\item Rotating a \gls*{textarea} and \gls*{path} and then combining
them to form a \gls*{textpath} is not the same as first combining
and then rotating.

\end{itemize}

To illustrate this, in \figureref{fig:rotateex1a} there are three
\glspl*{object} selected.  The selection is then rotated
\degrees{90}.  The result is shown in \figureref{fig:rotateex1b}.

in which you can specify the scale factor. There is a choice of
scaling just the $x$ dimension, just the $y$ dimension
or both dimensions.

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \Inlineglsdef{affine-transformation.reflection} can be
achieved with a negative scale factor.

\item Individual \glspl*{object} will be
scaled relative to the top left corner of the
object's \gls{bbox}.

\item \Glspl*{object} within a
\gls{group} will be scaled relative to the top left corner
of the group's \gls*{bbox}.

\item Scaling a \gls{textpath} will scale the path and the text
will adjust to follow the transformed path. Note that the text
itself will not be scaled.

\item Scaling a \gls*{textarea} and \gls*{path} and then combining
them to form a \gls*{textpath} is not the same as first combining
and then scaling.
\end{itemize}

To illustrate this, in \figureref{fig:scaleex1a} there are three
\glspl*{object} selected.
The selection is then scaled by a factor of 2.
The result is shown in \figureref{fig:scaleex1b}.

into a \gls*{textpath}, shown in
\figureref{fig:scaletextpathb}. This \gls*{textpath} is then
scaled by a factor of 2 resulting in
\figureref{fig:scaletextpathc}. Note that this is different

vertically, the bottom right hotspot to scale in both directions or
the middle right hotspot to scale horizontally. Note that even if
you have more than one object selected, only the object whose

\section{Shearing Objects}\label{sec:shearobjects}

\menudef{menu.transform.shear}

Selected \glspl{object} can be sheared with
the \menu{transform.shear} menu item. This will open up a dialog box
in which you can specify the shear factors. The shearing
transformation is given by:
\TeXParserLibToImage
[div=displaymath,alt={
 (
   [ 1 , sX ]
   [ sY , 1 ]
 )
 (
   [ x ]

  =
  \left(
  \begin{array}{l}
  x + s_x y\\
  y + s_y x
  \end{array}
  \right)
  \]
}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Individual \glspl*{object}
will be sheared relative to the bottom left corner of the
object's \gls{bbox}.

\item \Glspl*{object} within a 
\gls{group} will be sheared relative to the bottom
left corner of the group's \gls*{bbox}.

\item Shearing a \gls{textpath} will shear the path and the text
will adjust to follow the transformed path. Note that the text
itself will not be sheared.

\item Shearing a \gls*{textarea} and \gls*{path} and then combining
them to form a \gls*{textpath} is not the same as first combining
and then shearing. 

\item Shearing a \gls{pattern} will shear the underlying path not
the complete shape.
\end{itemize}

To illustrate this, in \figureref{fig:shearex1a} there are three
\glspl*{object} selected.  The selection is then sheared with shear
factors $s_x=1$ and $s_y=0$.  The result is shown in
\figureref{fig:shearex1b}.

In \figureref{fig:shearpatterna}, a \gls*{path} created using the

factors to a complete path rather than a pattern.

\section{Resetting a Transformation Matrix}\label{sec:resetmatrix}

\menudef{menu.transform.reset}

The \gls{transformation-matrix} for \glspl{textarea}, \glspl{textpath}
and \glspl{bitmap} can be reset via the
\menu{transform.reset} menu item. This will reset the scale
and shear factors (but not the translation) for \glspl{textarea},
and will reset all elements for \glspl{textpath} and \glspl{bitmap}.

\chapter{Modifying Shapes}\label{sec:modshape}

\Glspl{shape} are defined by their segment types (line, \gls{curve}
or \glspl{gap}) and \glspl{controlpt}, which may be adjusted in edit
path mode (see \sectionref{sec:editpath}). It's also possible to
modify \glspl{shape} using \glspl{affine-transformation} (see
\sectionref{sec:affinetrans}), \gls{cag} (see \sectionref{sec:cag}),
distortion (see \sectionref{sec:distort}), reversing the order of
the \glspl{controlpt} and segments (see \sectionref{sec:reversing}), merging paths (see
\sectionref{sec:mergepaths}), or converting into one or more other
\glspl{shape} (see \sectionref{sec:converttopolygon},
\sectionref{sec:separate}, \sectionref{sec:patterns},
\sectionref{sec:converttofullpath} and
\sectionref{sec:outlinetopath}). 

\section{Edit Path Mode}\label{sec:editpath}

\menudef{menu.edit.path.edit}

\Glspl{path} consist of a sequence of lines, curves and \glspl{gap} 
that are defined by \glspl{controlpt}. These \glspl{controlpt} may be adjusted in
\emph{\inlineglsdef{edit-path-mode}} which can be switched on and off
with the \menu{edit.path.edit} toggle menu item.

\begin{information}
Edit mode can't be enabled for a \gls{shape} that is part of a \gls{group}.
If the selected shape is a \gls{compositeshape}, edit mode will allow the
underlying path to be edited.
\end{information}

The \gls{menu.edit.path.edit} menu item
is only available if exactly one \gls{shape} and no other
\gls{object} is \selected.

\subsection{Control Points}\label{sec:editcontrolpt}

The \glspl{controlpt} that define a \gls{shape} only become visible
and interactive when the shape is in \editpathmode.
To move, delete or add \glspl{controlpt}, open or close
\glspl{path}, or to convert segments from one form (line, \gls{gap}, cubic
\gls{Bezier-curve}) to another, first \select\ the \gls*{shape}, and
then either click on the \gls{menu.edit.path.edit} icon or select
\menu{edit.path.edit}.

The \gls*{path} will then be displayed in draft format.  The
currently selected \gls*{controlpt} and the currently selected
segment will appear in red. The other \glspl*{controlpt} will be
orange.

\begin{information}
The \manmsgpl{colour} can be changed via the \widget{graphics.title}
tab in the \dialog{configui} dialog. The size of the
\glspl{controlpt} can be changed in the \widget{controls.title} tab
of the \dialog{config} dialog. You may also want to adjust the
\widget{editpathui.title} in the \widget{graphics.title} tab of the
\dialog{configui} dialog.
\end{information}

\Glspl{compositeshape} may also be edited with 
the \gls{menu.edit.path.edit} function. The
\glspl{controlpt} will only be those on the underlying path and 
the special controls that define the \gls{compositeshape}.

A \gls{textpath} object can have its underlying path edited in the
same way as a normal \gls{path}, but in edit mode you will also see
the text (without \gls{anti-aliasing}).  Note that you can not edit
a \gls{path} if it belongs to a \gls{group}; you must first
\hyperref[sec:grouping]{ungroup it}.

\begin{information}
\Glspl{controlpt} rather than segments are selectable. The segment
that the selected \gls{controlpt} belongs to will then be
highlighted. You can either select a \gls{controlpt} with the mouse
or use the \gls{menu.editpath.next_control} or \gls{menu.editpath.prev_control}
items in the \gls{index.menu.editpath}.
\end{information}

A selected \gls{controlpt} can be moved by dragging with the mouse.
In a cluttered image with overlapping \glspl{controlpt} it can be
difficult to select and move the desired \gls{controlpt}.
If two or more points coincide
with the location of the mouse, the point with the lowest
\glslink{ptindex}{index} will be selected.
You may find it easier to use the \gls{index.menu.editpath}.

Dragging doesn't automatically select a \gls{controlpt} otherwise it
would be easy to accidentally select a coincident \gls{controlpt}
when trying to move a currently selected \gls{controlpt}.
This means that you can initiate dragging outside of the selected
\gls*{controlpt}, but make sure that you
first click to change the selection before initiating a drag or you
may move the wrong control.

\begin{important}
With the \widget{editpathui.canvasclick} option on, if you
click outside of any \gls{controlpt} the path edit mode will be
switched off. Otherwise you will need to toggle the
\menu{edit.path.edit} menu item to switch off path edit mode.
\end{important}

If the \gridlock\ is on, mouse clicks will be translated to the
nearest tick mark, so even if the pointer is positioned over a
control point, the nearest tick mark may be outside the control
point bounds. Enabling the \widget{editpathui.ignorelock} option in 
the \widget{graphics.title} panel will ignore the \gridlock\ for the
purposes of selecting \glspl{controlpt}.

\menudef{index.menu.editpath}

In path edit mode, the \gls{popupmenu} will change from the usual
\selectmode\ menus to provide functions to edit the \gls{path}.

\FloatFig{fig:editPathPopup}
 {\includeimg{editPathPopup}}
 {Edit Path Popup Menu}

\menudef{menu.editpath.next_control}

The \menu{editpath.next_control} menu item will select the next \gls{controlpt}
(wrapping round to the start from the final \gls{controlpt}).
This is an alternative to using the mouse to select a point.

\menudef{menu.editpath.prev_control}

The \menu{editpath.prev_control} menu item will select the previous \gls{controlpt}
(wrapping round to the end from the first \gls{controlpt}).
This is an alternative to using the mouse to select a point.

\menudef{menu.editpath.delete_control}

The \menu{editpath.delete_control} menu item will delete the current
\gls{controlpt}. 
Note that certain \glspl{controlpt}, such as curvature controls or points
the define a \gls{compositeshape}, can't be deleted.

If the \gls{controlpt} is the first or last point in an open path
this function will delete the corresponding segment, otherwise it
will replace two adjacent segments with a single segment.  If the
path is open and only has one segment, or if the path is closed and
has two segments, deleting a control point will delete the
\gls{shape} or the \gls{textpath} object. (The text will also be lost when
the \gls{textpath} is deleted.)

\menudef{menu.editpath.add_control}

The \menu{editpath.add_control} menu item will add a new
\gls{controlpt} in the middle of the currently selected segment.
This actually replaces the selected segment with two new segments of 
half the length of the original that maintain the same shape.
This function is only available for normal path segments and not for
segments used to alter \glspl{compositeshape}.

\menudef{menu.editpath.convert_to_line}

The \menu{editpath.convert_to_line} menu item will convert the
current segment to a line. This function will be unavailable if the
current segment is already a line or if it isn't a normal path segment.

\menudef{menu.editpath.convert_to_curve}

The \menu{editpath.convert_to_curve} menu item will convert the
current segment to a \gls{Bezier-curve}. The new curvature 
\glspl{controlpt} can then be moved as required.
This function will be unavailable if the
current segment is already a \gls{Bezier-curve} or if it isn't a normal path segment.

\menudef{menu.editpath.convert_to_move}

The \menu{editpath.convert_to_move} menu item will convert the
current segment to a \gls{gap} (\qt{move to}). This function will be
unavailable if the current segment is already a \gls{gap} or if it
isn't a normal path segment.

\menudef{menu.editpath.symmetry}

The \menu{editpath.symmetry} sub menu can be used to add or remove
\gls{symmetry}.
See \sectionref{sec:symmetric} for further details.

\menudef{menu.editpath.continuity}

If the selected segment is a \gls{Bezier-curve}, the
\menu{editpath.continuity} sub menu provides functions that adjust
the curvature \gls*{controlpt} to ensure that the gradient at the
nearest join is continuous. This sub menu isn't available if it's not
possible to do this (for example, if the nearest join is an end
point). See \sectionref{sec:continous} for further details.

\menudef{menu.editpath.open_path}

The \menu{editpath.close_path} sub menu provides functions to open a
closed path.

\menudef{menu.editpath.open_path.remove_last}

The \menu{editpath.open_path.remove_last} menu item
opens the path, removing the last segment (\figureref{fig:openpathb}).

\menudef{menu.editpath.open_path.keep_last}

The \menu{editpath.open_path.keep_last} menu item
opens the path, but keeps the last segment (\figureref{fig:openpathb}).

   \subfigref{fig:openpatha} was opened, keeping the last segment.}

\menudef{menu.editpath.close_path}

The \menu{editpath.close_path} sub menu provides functions to join
the end of the \gls{shape} to its start to close an open path.

\menudef{menu.editpath.close_path.line}

The \menu{editpath.close_path.line} menu item will
close the path with a line between the last and first
\glspl*{controlpt} of the original path (\figureref{fig:closepatha}).

\menudef{menu.editpath.close_path.cont}

The \menu{editpath.close_path.cont} menu item will
close the path with a \gls{Bezier-curve} between the last and first
\glspl*{controlpt} such that the curve is continuous at the join
between the first and last segments of the original path
(\figureref{fig:closepathb}).

\menudef{menu.editpath.close_path.merge}

The \menu{editpath.close_path.merge} menu item will
close the path, merging the last \gls*{controlpt} of the original
path with the first \gls*{controlpt} (\figureref{fig:closepathc}).

\menudef{menu.editpath.coordinates}

The \menu{editpath.coordinates} menu item will display the
\inlineglsdef{coordinates.title} dialog box in which you can set the
\gls{controlpt}['s] $x$ and $y$ values (instead of dragging the
point to the required location).  Note that rounding errors may
occur if the unit used in this dialog doesn't have a convenient
conversion factor with the \gls{storageunit}.

\plabel[Segment Details]{mi:segmentinfo}% HelpSet id
\menudef{menu.editpath.info}

The \menu{editpath.info} menu item will option the 
\inlineglsdef{segmentinfo.title} dialog box shown in
\figureref{fig:segmentinfo}, which describes the segment type and
provides numeric fields in which to adjust the co-ordinates of the
segment. Note that the end \gls{controlpt} won't be enabled unless 
it's the end point of an open path.

Any changes made in this dialog won't take effect until you click on
the \btn{okay} button. The \btn{cancel} button will discard all the
changes (after prompting for confirmation). Use the 
\widget{segmentinfo.default} button to revert the working segment
back to its current state in the actual path.

\menudef{menu.editpath.snap}

The \menu{editpath.snap} menu item will
move the currently selected \gls*{controlpt} to the nearest
tick mark.

\plabel[Breaking a Path]{mi:breakpath}
\menudef{menu.editpath.break_path}

The \menu{editpath.break_path} menu item will split the current path
into two distinct \glspl{path} at the \emph{end} of the currently
selected segment (not at the currently selected \gls*{controlpt}).
One path will remain in \editpathmode. 
If the object is a \gls*{textpath}, the new \glspl*{textpath} will
both have the same text (that is, the text is not broken between
them).

\subsection{Gradient Continuity}\label{sec:continous}

Joins between \gls{path} segments, where one of both segments is a
\gls{Bezier-curve}, can be made continuous (a smooth join)
in \editpathmode\ with the \menu{editpath.continuity} sub menu.

\menudef{menu.editpath.continuity.equi}

The \menu{editpath.continuity.equi} menu item will move the selected
curvature \gls*{controlpt} so that it has the same gradient
direction and magnitude as the gradient vector on the other side of
the join.
This function is only available if the selected \gls{controlpt} is
a curvature control.

\menudef{menu.editpath.continuity.relative}

The \menu{editpath.continuity.relative} menu item will move the
selected curvature control so that it has the same direction as the
gradient on the other side of the join, but its magnitude will
remain unchanged. (See \figureref{fig:continuous}.)
This function is only available if the selected \gls{controlpt} is
a \gls{curvature-controlpt}.

\menudef{menu.editpath.continuity.anchor}

The \menu{editpath.continuity.anchor} menu item is only available
when a \gls*{controlpt} on the join between two \glspl{Bezier-curve}
has been selected. If this item is selected, when you adjust one of
the adjacent \glspl{curvature-controlpt}, the corresponding curvature
control on the other segment will be adjusted to maintain
\gls{continuity}. An \gls{continuity.anchor} image will appear in the control joining the
two segments when this setting is on (as shown in
\figureref{fig:continuityanchor}).

For example, in \figureref{fig:continuous} the path was originally
an open line \gls{path} with three line segments.  The middle segment was
selected and converted to a \gls{Bezier-curve} using the
\menu{editpath.convert_to_curve} function
(\figureref{fig:continuousa}). The
\menu{editpath.continuity.relative} function was then
used to change the starting \gls{gradient} of the \gls{Bezier-curve} to make
a smooth join between the first two segments
(\figureref{fig:continuousb}).  The \gls{Bezier-curve}['s] third
\gls*{controlpt}, which governs the end curvature, was selected, and
the \menu{editpath.continuity.relative} function was
again used to change the end \gls{gradient} of the \gls{Bezier-curve} to
make a smooth join between the last two segments
(\figureref{fig:continuousc}).

\subsection{Symmetric Shapes}\label{sec:symmetric}

\Glspl{symmetricshape} are created by applying
\inlineglsdef{symmetry} to an existing \gls{shape} in 
\editpathmode\ via the \menu{editpath.symmetry} sub menu.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:symmetric}

  {fig:symmetrica}{\includeimg{symmetrica}}{},
  {fig:symmetricb}{\includeimg{symmetricb}}{},
  {fig:symmetricc}{\includeimg{symmetricc}}{},

}
[Adding Symmetry to a Path]
{Adding Symmetry to a Path: \subfigref{fig:symmetrica} original path;
\subfigref{fig:symmetricb} symmetry added to path in \subfigref{fig:symmetrica} the
two blue controls govern the line of symmetry;
\subfigref{fig:symmetricc} the line of symmetry has been moved, altering the
overall appearance of the shape; \subfigref{fig:symmetricd} the end anchor
constraint has been removed and the end control has been moved
away from the line of symmetry; \subfigref{fig:symmetrice} the joining segment
has been converted to a curve with only one curvature control.}

\menudef{menu.editpath.symmetry.has_symmetry}

The \menu{editpath.symmetry.has_symmetry} menu item can be toggled
to add or remove \gls{symmetry}. Adding symmetry will replace the existing
\gls{shape} with a \gls{symmetricshape}. This has extra
\glspl{controlpt} that govern the \inlineglsdef{line-of-symmetry}.
Removing \gls{symmetry} will replace the existing \gls{symmetricshape}
with its underlying \gls{shape}.

For example, \figureref{fig:symmetrica} shows a \gls*{path}
in \editpathmode, and \figureref{fig:symmetricb} shows the
path with \gls{symmetry} applied to it. There are now two extra
\glspl{controlpt} (\manmsg{coloured} blue). These points govern the 
\gls{line-of-symmetry}. In \figureref{fig:symmetricc}, these two controls
have been moved.

\begin{information}
The \gls{line-of-symmetry} extends infinitely though the two controls,
but only the part of the line between the two points is actually
displayed in edit mode.
\end{information}

If you later decide to remove the symmetry, deselect
\menu{editpath.symmetry.has_symmetry}.

\begin{warning}
Adding \gls{symmetry} to a closed shape may cause unexpected
results as the shape will be first opened (without removing the
last segment), the \gls{symmetry} will be added, and then the symmetric
shape will be closed, merging the end points.
\end{warning}

\menudef{menu.editpath.symmetry.join_anchor}

The \menu{editpath.symmetry.join_anchor} menu item can be toggled to
determine whether or not the reflection is
\glslink{line-of-symmetry.anchor}{anchored} to the underlying
path at its end point. If this option is on, the end \gls{controlpt}
will be constrained to the \gls{line-of-symmetry}.  That is, the end
\gls{controlpt} can only move along the line defined by the two blue
\glspl*{controlpt}.  In \figureref{fig:symmetricd}, the
\menu{editpath.symmetry.join_anchor} item was deselected, and the
end control was then moved away from the \gls{line-of-symmetry}.

Note that this function places a \gls{gap} (move) segment between the
end control and its symmetric counterpart, which will produce an
unsymmetric effect if the path is then closed. This gap can be changed to
a line or curve, using \menu{editpath.convert_to_line} or
\menu{editpath.convert_to_curve}, as described in
\sectionref{sec:editpath}. In \figureref{fig:symmetrice},
the join has been changed to a curve. Unlike the \glspl{Bezier-curve}
in the non-symmetric paths, this curve only has one 
\gls{curvature-controlpt}.

The \gls{menu.editpath.symmetry.join_anchor} function is only available
if \gls{menu.editpath.symmetry.has_symmetry} is on.

\menudef{menu.editpath.symmetry.close_anchor}

The \menu{editpath.symmetry.close_anchor} menu item can be toggled
to determine whether or not the reflection is
\glslink{line-of-symmetry.anchor}{anchored} to the
underlying path at is start point.  If this option is on, the start
\gls{controlpt} will be constrained to the \gls{line-of-symmetry}.  This
function is only available if
\gls{menu.editpath.symmetry.has_symmetry} is on and the
underlying \gls{path} is closed.

For example, \figureref{fig:closedsymmetrica} shows a closed
symmetric path (a closed version of \figureref{fig:symmetrice}). The
\gls{line-of-symmetry.anchor} constraint on the first control was
then removed and the control was moved to the left
(\figureref{fig:closedsymmetricb}). As with the join segment (above)
the closing segment between the start control and its reflection can
be changed to a curve with one \gls{curvature-controlpt}
(\figureref{fig:closedsymmetricc}).

\FloatSubFigs{fig:closedsymmetric}

 {fig:closedsymmetrica}{\includeimg{closedsymmetrica}}{},
 {fig:closedsymmetricb}{\includeimg{closedsymmetricb}}{},

[Closed Symmetric Path]
{Closed symmetric path: \subfigref{fig:closedsymmetrica} the symmetric path in
\figureref{fig:symmetrice} has been closed\dash the
first control is now anchored to the line of symmetry;
\subfigref{fig:closedsymmetricb} deselecting the close anchor constraint allows
the start control to be moved away from the line of symmetry;
\subfigref{fig:closedsymmetricc} the segment closing the symmetric path has been
changed to a curve.}

\begin{warning}
Take care with closed symmetric paths. Unexpected results
may occur, particularly if the path contains any gaps. This may
cause the stroked or filled shape to appear unsymmetric.
For example, \figureref{fig:symgapa} shows the original
(non-symmetric path). This was then given a line of symmetry and
the path appears symmetric, as shown in \figureref{fig:symgapb}. In
\figureref{fig:symgapc}, two of the line segments have been
converted to gaps. The shape still appears symmetric although the
filled area has changed, but in \figureref{fig:symgapd} the path
has been closed with a line so although the control points that
make up right side of the complete path are a reflection of the
original points on the left side, the shape no longer appears
symmetric.
\end{warning}

\section{Merging Paths}\label{sec:mergepaths}

\menudef{menu.transform.merge}

Multiple \glspl{shape} can be merged into a single \gls*{shape}
using the \menu{transform.merge} menu item. Note that this is not
the same as \hyperref[sec:grouping]{grouping}.  A \gls{gap} (move
to) will be placed between the last \gls{controlpt} of one path and
the first \gls*{controlpt} of the next path. Any \gls{pattern} in
the selection will be first \hyperref[sec:converttofullpath]{converted
to a full path} before merging.

\begin{information}
To split an existing \gls{path} into two separate \glspl{path}, use the
\menu{editpath.break_path} popup menu item in \editpathmode.
\end{information}

Once the shape has been merged, it can then be edited as usual in
\editpathmode.  If the original shapes had different styles, the new
shape will retain the style of the first shape (the lowest one in
the \gls{stack}). For example, in \figureref{fig:mergea} there are
two \glspl{path} with different styles. \figureref{fig:mergeb} shows
the single \gls{path} created from merging the two original paths.
Since the first path used the even-odd winding rule, the new shape
has a hole in it.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:merge}
{
  {fig:mergea}{\includeimg{mergepatha}}{},
  {fig:mergeb}{\includeimg{mergepathb}}{}
}
[Merging Two Paths]
{Merging two paths:
\subfigref{fig:mergea} the first path has a solid line pattern, a
green fill \manmsg{colour} and even-odd winding rule, and the second
path has a dashed line pattern and a yellow fill \manmsg{colour};
\subfigref{fig:mergeb} resulting merged path has a solid line
pattern, green fill \manmsg{colour} and even-odd winding rule.}

The same applies if one or more of the selected \glspl*{object} is a
\gls{textpath}. For example, in \figureref{fig:mergetextpathsa}
there are two \glspl*{textpath}.  These are merged to form a single
\gls*{textpath} shown in \figureref{fig:mergetextpathsb}. Note that
the text from the second \gls{textpath} is lost. The resulting path
is shown in \editpathmode\ in \figureref{fig:mergetextpathsc} to
illustrate the underlying path. A mixture of \glspl*{path} and
\glspl*{textpath} can be merged. The resulting \gls*{object} will be
a \gls*{textpath} if the first object to be merged is a
\gls*{textpath}, otherwise it will be a \gls*{path}.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:mergetextpaths}
{

edit mode to illustrate the underlying path}

\Glspl{path} are merged according to their \gls{stackingorder}. For
example, in \figureref{fig:merge2a} there are two \glspl{path}, both
with a bar start marker, and an arrow end marker. The path on the
right is further back in terms of the \gls{stackingorder}. (That is,
it gets \glslink{painting}{painted} on the \gls{canvas} before the
other path.) \figureref{fig:merge2b} shows the result of merging the
two paths\dash the left hand path has been appended to the right
hand path. \figureref{fig:merge2c} shows the same two paths as in
\figureref{fig:merge2a} except that now the left path is the
\gls{back}. There is no visible difference between
\figureref{fig:merge2a} and \figureref{fig:merge2c}, but the result
of merging the paths in \figureref{fig:merge2c} (see
\figureref{fig:merge2d}) is different to
\figureref{fig:merge2b}\dash the right hand path has been appended
to the left hand path.

\section{Reversing a Path's Direction}\label{sec:reversing}

\menudef{menu.transform.reverse}

The direction of a \gls{path} or \gls{textpath} can be reversed
using the \menu{transform.reverse} menu item. For example, the path
in \figureref{fig:reverse} has a bar start marker, pointed arrow
mid-markers and a \LaTeX\ style arrow end marker.
\figureref{fig:reversea} shows the original path, and
\figureref{fig:reverseb} shows the reversed path. Note that all the
\glspl{controlpt} are in the same place, but their ordering has
changed, so that what was originally the first \gls{controlpt} is
now the last \gls{controlpt}.

In \figureref{fig:reversetextpath}, the \gls*{textpath} in
\figureref{fig:reversetextpatha} is reversed to form 
\figureref{fig:reversetextpathb}. Note that the text now starts
from the right instead of the left, since the first \gls*{controlpt}
is now on the right, and it is upside-down.

reversed so the text starts from the other end.}

\section{Convert to Polygon}\label{sec:converttopolygon}

If you want to convert a single \gls{curve} segment to a single
line segment, you can simply enable \editpathmode, and use the 
\menu{editpath.convert_to_line} item from the popup menu.
However, if you want to replace every curve with one or more straight
lines then you may prefer to use the \transformfn{convert_to_polygon}
function.

\menudef{menu.transform.convert_to_polygon}

The \gls{curve} segments of a \gls{path} (or underlying path)
can be converted into a series of straight line segments with the
\menu{transform.convert_to_polygon} menu item, which will result in
a polygonal shape. The number of lines used to replace an individual
curve segment is determined by the \emph{flatness} parameter.

\begin{information}
There is a maximum limit of 1024 replacement line segments per
\gls{curve}.
\end{information}

First \select\ the \gls{shape} with \glspl{curve} that need to be transformed.
For example, in \figureref{fig:converttopolygona} a closed \gls{path}
with four \gls{curve} segments has been selected.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:converttopolygon}
{
  {fig:converttopolygona}{\includeimg{converttopolygona}}{},
  {fig:converttopolygonb}{\includeimg{converttopolygonb}}{}

{Converting a shape with curves to a polygon:
\subfigref{fig:converttopolygona} original shape with four
curve segments;
\subfigref{fig:converttopolygonb} converted shape (flatness 4.0) 
with fourteen line segments.}


\widgetdef{polygon.title}

The \menu{transform.convert_to_polygon} menu item will open the
\dialog{polygon} dialog, shown in \figureref{fig:polygondialog}.
This will show a draft outline of the selected shape (in this case,
the shape from \figureref{fig:converttopolygona}).

\FloatFig{fig:polygondialog}
{\includeimg{polygondialog}}
{Convert to Polygon Dialog}

\widgetdef{polygon.flatness}

The \widget{polygon.flatness} numeric field should be set to the
flatness parameter. This is the maximum allowable distance (in \gls{bp})
between the \glspl{controlpt} and the flattened \gls{curve}. A small
value will create a series of line segments that are as close to the
original curve as possible. This may result in many short line
segments depending on the curvature of the original \gls{curve}.

\widgetdef{polygon.dotask}

Once you have set the desired flatness parameter, click on the
\widget{polygon.dotask} button. This will draw the calculated
polygon over the original shape for comparison. For example, 
\figureref{fig:polygondialog1} shows the calculated polygon with
the flatness parameter set to 1.

\FloatFig{fig:polygondialog1}
{\includeimg{polygondialog1}}
{Convert to Polygon Dialog: Result with 1.0 Flatness}

On the right-hand side of the \dialog{polygon} dialog is an
information panel that details the number of lines used, the length
of the polygon's perimeter, the polygon's area and the \gls{xor} area.
It also lists the path's definition where \qt{M} indicates a move to
(followed by the co-ordinate pair to move to), \qt{L} indicates a line to
(followed by the co-ordinate pair to draw a line to), and \qt{Z}
indicates close path.

If the result isn't quite satisfactory, you can adjust the flatness
parameter and click on the \widget{polygon.dotask} button again.
For example, I changed the flatness to 4 and recalculated. This
produced the polygon shown in \figureref{fig:polygondialog2} which
has fewer line segments with a greater deviation from the original
shape.

\FloatFig{fig:polygondialog2}
{\includeimg{polygondialog2}}
{Convert to Polygon Dialog: Result with 4.0 Flatness}

\widgetdef{polygon.reload}

You can clear the dialog and reset it back to just the original
selected shape with the \widget{polygon.reload} button.
There is also a zoom widget on the bottom left which can be used to
adjust the magnification.

If you want to replace the selected path with the
calculated polygon, click on the \widget{okay} button.  For example,
\figureref{fig:converttopolygonb} is the result with the flatness set
to 4. Note that this new polygonal shape has more segments that the 
original curving shape.

\begin{information}
The \widget{okay} button is only enabled once a polygon has been
calculated. If you change you mind you can click on the \widget{cancel}
button to discard the draft. You will be prompted for confirmation
if a polygon has been calculated.
\end{information}


\section{Constructive Area Geometry (CAG)}\label{sec:cag}

\Glsxtrfull{cag} is the process of creating new geometric objects by
performing logical operations on existing objects. These functions
replace two or more \selected\ \glspl*{shape} with a new single
\gls{shape}.

\subsection{Path Union}\label{sec:pathunion}

\menudef{menu.transform.union}

Area \inlineglsdef{cag.addition} can be performed on
\glspl{shape} with the \menu{transform.union} menu item. That is,
multiple \glspl{shape} can be combined into a single \gls*{shape} by
performing a union on all the selected \glspl*{shape}.

At least two \glspl*{shape} must be selected to perform this
function. As with the \hyperref[sec:mergepaths]{merge path function}, the
new shape has the same styles as the \glslink{back}{backmost} path
in the selection.

For example, in \figureref{fig:pathuniona}, there are three
overlapping paths.  In \figureref{fig:pathunionb} the paths have
been replaced by a single path created using the path union
function. For comparison, the same three paths in
\figureref{fig:pathuniona} were replaced using the
\hyperref[sec:mergepaths]{merge function}. The result is shown in
\figureref{fig:pathunionc}.

\FloatSubFigs*{fig:pathunion}

  {fig:pathunionb}{\includeimg{pathunion}}{},

\subfigref{fig:pathuniona} have been replaced by a single path using

In \figureref{fig:textpathunion}, a \gls*{textpath} and a
\gls*{path} are combined: \figureref{fig:textpathuniona} shows
the original objects and \figureref{fig:textpathunionb} shows
the resulting object. In this case, the resulting object is a
\gls*{textpath} since the \glslink{back}{backmost} path in
\figureref{fig:textpathuniona} was the \gls*{textpath} object.

Any \gls{pattern} in the selection will first be converted to a full
\gls{path} before the union is applied. For example, in
\figureref{fig:patternunion}, two patterns are combined:
\figureref{fig:patternuniona} shows the original patterns (both have
a rotational pattern with 2 replicas) and
\figureref{fig:patternunionb} shows the resulting path. This path is

\subsection{Exclusive Or Function}\label{sec:xorpath}

\menudef{menu.transform.xor}

Area \inlineglsdef{cag.xor} can be performed on \glspl{shape} with
the \menu{transform.xor} menu item. That is, multiple \glspl{shape}
can be combined into a single \gls*{shape} by performing an
\gls{cag.xor} operation on all the selected \glspl*{shape}.  At
least two \glspl*{shape} must be selected to perform this function.
As with the \hyperref[sec:mergepaths]{merge path function}, the new
\gls*{shape} has the same styles as the \glslink{back}{backmost}
path in the selection and \glspl{pattern} will be converted to full
\glspl{path}.

For example, in \figureref{fig:xorpatha}, there are three
overlapping paths.  The rear path has a non-zero winding rule. In
\figureref{fig:xorpathb} the paths have been replaced by a
single path created using the \transformfn{xor} function. For comparison,
the same three paths in \figureref{fig:xorpatha} were replaced
using the \hyperref[sec:mergepaths]{merge function}. The result is
shown in \figureref{fig:xorpathc}. Both paths in
\figureref{fig:xorpathb} and \figureref{fig:xorpathc} use
a non-zero winding rule, since that was used by the rear path in
\figureref{fig:xorpatha}.

\subsection{Path Intersection}\label{sec:pathintersect}

\menudef{menu.transform.intersect}

Area \inlineglsdef{cag.intersection} can be performed on \glspl{shape} with
the \menu{transform.intersect} menu item. That is, multiple \glspl{shape}
can be combined into a single \gls*{shape} by performing an
\gls{cag.intersection} operation on all the selected \glspl*{shape}.  At
least two \glspl*{shape} must be selected to perform this function, 
and at least two of the shapes (or underlying path
in the case of a \gls{textpath}) must overlap.
As with the \hyperref[sec:mergepaths]{merge path function}, the new
\gls*{shape} has the same styles as the \glslink{back}{backmost}
path in the selection and \glspl{pattern} will be converted to full
\glspl{path}.

For example, in \figureref{fig:pathintersecta},
there are three overlapping paths.  In
\figureref{fig:pathintersectb} the paths have been replaced by
a single path created using the path intersect function.

\subsection{Path Subtraction}\label{sec:pathsubtract}

\menudef{menu.transform.subtract}

Area \inlineglsdef{cag.subtraction} can be performed on \glspl{shape} with
the \menu{transform.subtract} menu item. That is, multiple \glspl{shape}
can be combined into a single \gls*{shape} by performing a
\gls{cag.subtraction} operation on all the selected \glspl*{shape}.  At
least two \glspl*{shape} must be selected to perform this function.
The new shape is the \glslink{back}{backmost} selected shape with
the other selected shapes subtracted from it. Any \glspl{pattern} in
the selection will be converted to full paths.

For example, in
\figureref{fig:pathsubtracta}, there are three overlapping
paths.  In \figureref{fig:pathsubtractb} the paths have been
replaced by a single path created using the path subtraction
function.

The new path will be a \gls*{textpath} if the backmost selected
object was a \gls*{textpath} and the text will adjust to fit the
new underlying path. For example, in
\figureref{fig:textpathsubtracta}, there is a \gls*{textpath}
and a \gls*{path}. The \gls*{textpath} is the backmost path.
In \figureref{fig:textpathsubtractb}, the two objects have
been replaced by a single \gls*{textpath} using the path subtraction
function.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:pathsubtract}

\section{Distorting Shapes}\label{sec:distort}

\menudef{menu.transform.distort}

A selected \gls{path} (not a \gls{compositeshape}) can be distorted using the
\menu{transform.distort} menu item. While this toggle
button\slash item is on, the \gls{path} is in distortion mode.
This has four round controls that are initially located at each
corner of the path's \gls{bbox}. These controls can be moved to
distort the path.  Note that this modifies the location of the
path's \glspl{controlpt}. The stroke attributes, such as the line
width, aren't modified. Once you have finished distorting the shape,
uncheck the \menu{transform.distort} menu item (or the
button on the horizontal \gls{toolbar}) or click
anywhere outside the (original) bounding box.

For example, \figureref{fig:distortpatha} shows a circle in 
\editpathmode. In \figureref{fig:distortpathb}, the \editpathmode\ is now off and
the circle is selected. In \figureref{fig:distortpathc}, the
distortion mode has now been switched on. The round distortion
controls are initialised to each corner of the \gls{bbox}. The
controls that define the path aren't visible. (Note that the
\hyperref[sec:graphics]{rendering hints} have been set to speed
and no anti-aliasing while in distortion mode.)

In \figureref{fig:distortpathd}, three of the round distortion
controls have been moved. The original bounding box is still
visible, even though it no longer encompasses the distorted shape.
In \figureref{fig:distortpathe}, the distortion mode has been
switched off and normal select mode has resumed. The modified path
is now showing with its new \gls{bbox}. The distortion moved the
path's \glspl{controlpt}, as can be seen when the path is put back into
\editpathmode\ in \figureref{fig:distortpathf}. If this path is
returned to distortion mode, the distortion controls will be reinitialised to
the corners of the new bounding box. You can't invert the distortion
to restore the path to its original shape.

\section{Converting a Path or Text-Path into a Pattern}\label{sec:patterns}

\menudef{menu.transform.pattern}
Patterns can be created, modified or removed with the
\menu{transform.pattern} sub menu. The following pattern types
are available:
\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\glslink{rotationalpattern}{Rotational}}

\begin{itemdesc}
The replicates will be rotated around the original
shape. For example, if you specify an angle of \degrees{90} and 4
replicas, the first replicate with be created by rotating a copy of
the original by \degrees{90}, the second replicate by \degrees{180},
the third by \degrees{270} and the fourth replicate by
\degrees{360}, which will superimpose it over the original.
In this case, the fourth replicate is redundant if the original path
is shown, so it would be better to set the number of replicas to 3.

The point of rotation is initially set to the \manmsg{centre} of the original
shape, but can be moved to a different location when the shape is in
\editpathmode. (See \figureref{fig:patternrot}.)

\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\glslink{scaledpattern}{Scaled}}

\begin{itemdesc}
The replicates will be scaled versions of the original
shape. There are two \glspl{controlpt} that govern the pattern: the
anchor, which can be freely moved, and the offset, which is
constrained to lie along the scaling axis. (See
\figureref{fig:patternscale}.)
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\glslink{spiralpattern}{Spiral}}

\begin{itemdesc}
The replicates will be placed in a spiral around the
original with the given incremental angle. There are again two
\glspl{controlpt} that govern the pattern: the anchor and offset,
which can both be moved freely. (See \figureref{fig:patternspiral}.)
\end{itemdesc}

in \subfigref{fig:patternspirala} in edit path mode: the green control is
the anchor and the cyan control is the offset;
\subfigref{fig:patternspiralc} the anchor has been moved down.}

\menudef{menu.transform.pattern.set}

A \gls{path} or \gls{textpath} can be converted into a pattern using
the \menu{transform.pattern.set} menu item. First \select\ the
required \gls{path} or \gls{textpath} (ensure that nothing else is
selected) and use the \menu{transform.pattern.set} menu item to open
the \dialog{pattern} dialog.

\menudef{menu.transform.pattern.edit}

An existing \gls{pattern} can be edited with the \menu{transform.pattern.edit}
menu item. First \select\ the required pattern (ensure that nothing else is
selected) and use the \menu{transform.pattern.edit} menu item to open
the \dialog{pattern} dialog where you can adjust the pattern
parameters.

\menudef{menu.transform.pattern.remove}

If you want to remove the pattern specifications, \select\ the
required pattern (ensure that nothing else is selected) and use the
\menu{transform.pattern.remove} menu item.  This will replace the
selected \gls{pattern} with its underlying path.

\widgetdef{pattern.title}

The \dialog{pattern} dialog allows you to set up (or edit) the pattern
specifications (see \figureref{fig:patterndialog}).

\FloatSubFigs{fig:patterndialog}
{
  {fig:patterndialog-rotational}{\includeimg{patterndialog-rotational}}{},

\widgetdef{pattern.replicas}

Specify the number of replicates in the \widget{pattern.replicas} field.

\widgetdef{pattern.show_original}

Toggle the  \widget{pattern.show_original} checkbox to set whether
or not the original \gls*{path} or \gls*{textpath} should be
displayed. For example, if you specify 4 replicates and show the
original, there will be 5 versions of the shape: the original and
the 4 replicas.

\widgetdef{pattern.rotational}

For a \gls{rotationalpattern}, select the
\widget{pattern.rotational} tab in which you can specify the degrees
of rotation in the \inlineglsdef{pattern.rotate} field.

\widgetdef{pattern.scaled}

For a \gls{scaledpattern}, select the \widget{pattern.scaled} tab
in which you can enter the horizontal scaling in the
\inlineglsdef{pattern.scale.x} field and the vertical scaling in 
the \inlineglsdef{pattern.scale.y} field.
Either scale factor may be negative but neither may be zero.

\widgetdef{pattern.spiral}

For a \gls{spiralpattern}, select the \widget{pattern.spiral} tab.
This also has a \widget{pattern.rotate} field, as for the
\widget{pattern.rotational} tab, but the \widget{pattern.spiral} tab
also has the \inlineglsdef{pattern.spiral.distance} field.

\widgetdef{pattern.mode}

All patterns have two modes:
\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\inlineglsdef{pattern.mode.single}}
\begin{itemdesc}
The pattern is drawn as a single path (see \figureref{fig:patternmodeb}).
Select \widget{pattern.mode.single} for single mode.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\inlineglsdef{pattern.mode.multi}}
\begin{itemdesc}
The original (if shown) and each replicate are drawn as 
independent shapes (see \figureref{fig:patternmodec}).
Select \widget{pattern.mode.multi} for multi mode.
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

\FloatSubFigs*{fig:patternmode}

\section{Separating Compound Shapes}\label{sec:separate}

\menudef{menu.transform.separate}

\Glspl{compositeshape} can be separated into its constituent parts
according to their type using the \menu{transform.separate} menu
item.  For example, in \figureref{fig:separatepatterna} a
\gls{rotationalpattern} with four replicas has been selected. In
\figureref{fig:separatepatternb} the pattern is shown in
\editpathmode\ for illustration. This mode needs to be switched off
to separate the component parts. The \transformfn{separate} function
was then used to replace the original selected \gls{pattern} with a
group containing the original path and each of the four replicas as
separate \glspl{path}. The group was then ungrouped
(\figureref{fig:separatepatternc}).

\FloatSubFigs{fig:separatepattern}
{
  {fig:separatepatterna}{\includeimg{separatepatterna}}{},
  {fig:separatepatternb}{\includeimg{separatepatternb}}{},
  {fig:separatepatternc}{\includeimg{separatepatternc}}{}
}
[Separating a Pattern]
{Separating a pattern:
\subfigref{fig:separatepatterna} selected pattern with four
replicas;
\subfigref{fig:separatepatternb} the pattern in \subfigref{fig:separatepatterna}
is shown in edit path mode to show the underlying path;
\subfigref{fig:separatepatternc} the pattern in \subfigref{fig:separatepatterna}
was separated into a group of paths and then ungrouped.}

A \gls{textpath} can similarly be separated into a group containing the
\gls{textarea} and \gls{path} that made up the \gls*{textpath}.
Note that any line styles that were applied to the path before
combining it with the text area will be lost, and the resulting
path will use the default styles with the \gls{index.line-colour} the same
as the \gls{index.text-colour} from the \gls*{textpath}.

For example, in \figureref{fig:separate} the \gls*{textarea} and
\gls*{path} in \figureref{fig:separatea} are combined to
form the \gls*{textpath} in \figureref{fig:separateb}. The
\gls*{textpath} is the separated into a group containing a
\gls*{textarea} and a \gls*{path}. Note that the new path has
lost the line style shown in \figureref{fig:separatea}
and is now the same \manmsg{colour} as the text.

\FloatSubFigs*{fig:separate}

  {fig:separatea}{\includeimg{separatea}}{},

\subfigref{fig:separatec} text-path 
in \subfigref{fig:separateb} separated into
a group containing a text area and a path.}

You may have noticed from \figureref{fig:separate} that the 
\pathattr{fill-paint} has been retained. This is because it may be needed if the
\textattr{outline} mode is on.  If a non-outline \gls{textpath} is switched to
\textattr{outline} mode with a filled interior, that \manmsg{colour} will be applied
to the new \gls{path}, as illustrated in \figureref{fig:separateoutline}.

\section{Converting a Composite Shape to a Full Path}\label{sec:converttofullpath}

\menudef{menu.transform.convert_to_full}

A \gls{compositeshape} may be converted into a normal path with the
\menu{transform.convert_to_full} menu item.  For example,
\figureref{fig:convertpatterntofullpatha} shows a
\gls{rotationalpattern} with 6\gls{bp} \pathattr{line-width}, black
\pathattr{line-paint} and orchid \pathattr{fill-paint}.  This
pattern is shown in \editpathmode\ in
\figureref{fig:convertpatterntofullpathb}. Note that only the
underlying path's \glspl{controlpt} and the pattern
\gls{pattern.anchor} are visible. (The \editpathmode\ will then need
to be switched off.) The \transformfn{convert_to_full} function was
then used convert the \gls{pattern} info a complete \gls{path}
(\figureref{fig:convertpatterntofullpathc}).  Note that's no
noticeable difference to the way the \gls{shape} is drawn on the
\gls{canvas}. However, if \editpathmode\ is switched on again
(\figureref{fig:convertpatterntofullpathd}) it now becomes clear
that the shape is no longer a \gls{pattern}. All \glspl{controlpt}
are now showing and there's no \gls{pattern.anchor} control.

\section{Converting an Outline to a Path}\label{sec:outlinetopath}

\menudef{menu.transform.convert}

The stroked outline of a \gls{shape}, \gls{textarea} or
\gls{textpath} may be converted to a filled path
with the \menu{transform.convert} menu item.
First \select\ the required \glspl{shape}, \glspl{textarea} or
\glspl{textpath}. The selection should not include any \glspl{group}
or \glspl{bitmap}. Then use the \menu{transform.convert} menu item.

Any \gls{shape} will be converted into a \gls{path} with 1\gls{bp}
line width that traces around the original stroked path. The new
path will be filled with the original \pathattr{line-paint} and
will have no \pathattr{line-paint}. The original
\pathattr{fill-paint} will be discarded.

For example, consider the path in \figureref{fig:outlinetopatha}.
This has a line width of 10\gls{bp}, a circle start marker,
a triangle end arrow, a gradient \pathattr{line-paint} and a yellow
\pathattr{fill-paint}. \figureref{fig:outlinetopathb} shows this
path in \editpathmode\ to show the path's defining \glspl{controlpt}. In
\figureref{fig:outlinetopathc}, the path's outline
has been converted to a path. This new path now has
a gradient \pathattr{fill-paint} with a line width of 1\gls{bp} and
no start or end arrows. The new path's defining
control points are shown in \figureref{fig:outlinetopathd}.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:outlinetopath}
{
  {fig:outlinetopatha}{\includeimg{outline2patha}}{},

\subfigref{fig:outlinetopathd} the new path's defining control points.}

Any selected \gls{pattern} will have its underlying path
converted to an outline. For example, the \gls{pattern}
from \figureref{fig:convertpatterntofullpatha} (reshown in
\figureref{fig:convertpatterntooutlinea}) has instead been
converted into an outline with the \transformfn{convert} function
(\figureref{fig:convertpatterntooutlineb}). The original orchid
\pathattr{fill-paint} has been discarded. The new
\pathattr{fill-paint} is now the original \pathattr{line-paint}
(black). The new \pathattr{line-paint} is now set to \gls{transparent}
(that is the outline isn't drawn). Switching to \editpathmode\
(\figureref{fig:convertpatterntooutlinec}) shows the new underlying
path that draws around the original stroked path. Note that the
\gls{shape} is still a \gls{pattern} and still has the pattern
\gls{pattern.anchor} in the same place (see \figureref{fig:convertpatterntofullpathb}).

outline;
\subfigref{fig:convertpatterntooutlinec} the pattern
in \subfigref{fig:convertpatterntooutlineb} showing in edit path

Any selected \gls{textarea} or \gls{textpath} will be replaced with
a \gls{group} of \glspl{path} with 1\gls{bp} line width that trace
around the approximate shape of the original characters. These new
\glspl{path} will be filled with the original
\gls{index.text-colour} and will have no \gls{index.line-colour}.
Converting a \gls*{textarea} or \gls*{textpath} to a path allows you to:
\begin{itemize}
\item include the image in \LaTeX\ document when you don't have the
equivalent \LaTeX\ font;

\item make a \gls{parshape} or \gls{shapepar}
from the text's outline.
\end{itemize}

\begin{information}
Unlike the text \textattr{outline} mode, it's no longer possible to
edit the text once its outline has been converted to a path.
\end{information}

You will have to \hyperref[sec:grouping]{ungroup} the
\glspl*{path} before you can apply any functions that require
individual \glspl{shape} and not \glspl{group} to be selected.  If you
had a gradient paint \gls{index.text-colour} the gradient will be
applied to each \gls*{path}. You can however,

\chapter{Path and Text Styles}\label{sec:styles}

The way a \gls{shape} is displayed is governed by the 
\pathattr{line-paint}, the \pathattr{fill-paint}, the 
\gls{line-style} and the \pathattr{winding-rule}. 
The way a \gls{textarea} is displayed is governed by the
\gls{index.text-colour}, \gls{font}, \textattr{transformation-matrix} 
and (if \hyperref[sec:exportimage]{exporting} to a \LaTeX\ file) the
\textattr{anchor}. The way a \gls{textpath} is displayed is governed
by the \gls{index.text-colour}, \gls{font}, \textattr{anchor},
\textattr{transformation-matrix} and the underlying path. (A
\gls*{textarea} or \gls*{textpath} may also be rendered as an
\textattr{outline} optionally with a \textattr{fill-paint}, see
\sectionref{sec:textoutline}.)

\menudef{menu.settings.styles}

The current path and text styles can be set using the
\menu{settings.styles} menu item which opens the \dialog{styles}
dialog. These styles will be used for any new \glspl{object} that
are subsequently created. Existing \glspl{object} can have their
styles altered via the \menu{edit.path} and \menu{edit.textarea}
sub-menus. 

\widgetdef{styles.title}

The \dialog{styles} dialog box has a tabbed pane with five tabs,
which may be used to change the current path and text styles.
Note that changing the current path or text styles won't affect
existing \glspl{object}. 

There is a sample panel on the right hand side illustrating the
effects of the \gls{path} settings you choose, and a sample panel along
the top illustrating the effects of the \gls*{textarea} attributes
you choose.

The current styles are saved when you exit \FlowframTk, and will be in
effect next time you use \FlowframTk, unless you change the 
\widget{initsettings.title} settings in the \dialog{config} dialog
(see \sectionref{sec:initsettings}).

The \dialog{styles} dialog has the following tabs:
\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\widget{linecolour.title}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the current \pathattr{line-paint} (see
\sectionref{sec:linepaint}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{fillcolour.title}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the current \pathattr{fill-paint} (see
\sectionref{sec:fillpaint}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{linestyle.title}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the current \gls{line-style} (see
\sectionref{sec:pathstyle}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{textcolour.title}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the current \gls{index.text-colour} (see
\sectionref{sec:textpaint}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{font.title}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the current \gls{font} and \textattrpl{anchor} (see
\sectionref{sec:textstyle}).
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

The \gls{button.default} button located at the bottom right corner
of the dialog box may be used to restore the default settings.

\section{Line Paint}\label{sec:linepaint}

\menudef{menu.edit.path.line_colour}

The \menu{edit.path.line_colour} menu item opens a dialog
with a \widget{linecolour.title} panel in which
you can change the \inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.line-paint} 
of all \selected\ \glspl{shape}.

\widgetdef{linecolour.title}

The \widget{linecolour.title} panel has a \dialog{colour} panel
(see \sectionref{sec:paint}) that may be used to set the 
\pathattr{line-paint}. This panel is also a tab
in the \dialog{styles} dialog to set the current
\pathattr{line-paint}.
The default \pathattr{line-paint} is black.

Selecting the \widget{colour.transparent} radio button indicates
that \gls{shape} outlines should not be drawn.  (The \pathattr{fill-paint}
will need to be set to something other than
\widget{colour.transparent} in order for the \glspl{shape} to be
visible.)

There is a sample panel along the top (\menu{edit.path.line_colour})
or the side (\menu{settings.styles}) illustrating the
effects of the \pathattr{line-paint} setting that you choose

\section{Fill Paint}\label{sec:fillpaint}

\menudef{menu.edit.fill_colour}

The \menu{edit.fill_colour} menu item opens a dialog with a
\widget{fillcolour.title} panel in which you can change the
\inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.fill-paint} of all \selected\
\glspl{shape}. The \pathattr{fill-paint} is also used to fill
\glspl{textarea} or \glspl{textpath} in \textattr{outline} mode. 

\widgetdef{fillcolour.title}

The \widget{fillcolour.title} panel has a \dialog{colour} panel (see
\sectionref{sec:paint}) that may be used to set the
\pathattr{fill-paint}. This panel is also a tab in the
\dialog{styles} dialog to set the current \pathattr{fill-paint}.

The default \pathattr{fill-paint} is \gls{transparent} which indicates
that \glspl{shape} should not be filled.  (The \pathattr{line-paint}
will need to be set to something other than
\widget{colour.transparent} in order for the \glspl{shape} to be
visible.)

There is a sample panel along the top (\menu{edit.fill_colour})
or the side (\menu{settings.styles}) illustrating the
effects of the \pathattr{fill-paint} setting that you choose

\seealsorefs{sec:houseexample}

\section{Line Style}\label{sec:pathstyle}

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.all_styles}

The \menu{edit.path.style.all_styles} menu item opens a dialog
with a \widget{linestyle.title} panel in which
you can change the \inlineglsdef{line-style} 
of all \selected\ \glspl{shape}.

\widgetdef{linestyle.title}

The \widget{linestyle.title} panel is also a tab
in the \dialog{styles} dialog to set the current
\gls{line-style}. The panel has the following areas:
\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\widget{linestyle.thickness}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the \pathattr{line-width} (\sectionref{sec:penwidth}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{linestyle.solid}\slash\widget{linestyle.dashed}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies whether the line is \gls{solid-line} or a \pathattr{dash-pattern}
(\sectionref{sec:dashpattern}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{linestyle.cap}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the \pathattr{cap-style} (see \sectionref{sec:capstyle}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{linestyle.join}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the \pathattr{join-style} (\sectionref{sec:joinstyle}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{linestyle.arrow.start}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the start \pathattr{marker} (\sectionref{sec:markers}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{linestyle.arrow.mid}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the mid \pathattr{marker} (\sectionref{sec:markers}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{linestyle.arrow.end}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the end \pathattr{marker} (\sectionref{sec:markers}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{linestyle.winding_rule}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the \pathattr{winding-rule} (\sectionref{sec:winding}).
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

There is a sample panel along the top (\menu{edit.path.style.all_styles})
or the side (\menu{settings.styles}) illustrating the
effects of the \gls{path} settings you choose

\begin{information}
The line styles are only applicable when the \gls{shape}
outline is \glslink{drawing-on-canvas}{drawn}. (That is, when 
the \pathattr{line-paint} is not set to \gls{transparent}.)
\end{information}

\subsection{Line Thickness (or Pen Width)}\label{sec:penwidth}

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.linewidth}

The \menu{edit.path.style.linewidth} menu item opens a dialog
with a \widget{linestyle.thickness} panel in which
you can change the \inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.line-width} 
of all \selected\ \glspl{shape}.

\widgetdef{linestyle.thickness}

The \widget{linestyle.thickness} panel is also in the 
\widget{linestyle.title} panel. The value is a length so it needs
both a positive decimal number and a unit. The default is 1\gls{bp}.

\begin{information}
The \pathattr{line-width} is only applicable when the \gls{shape}
outline is \glslink{drawing-on-canvas}{drawn}. (That is, when 
the \pathattr{line-paint} is not set to \gls{transparent}.)
\end{information}

\subsection{Dash Pattern}\label{sec:dashpattern}

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.dashpattern}

The \menu{edit.path.style.dashpattern} menu item opens a dialog
with a \widget{dashpattern.title} panel in which
you can change the \inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.dash-pattern} 
of all \selected\ \glspl{shape}.

\widgetdef{dashpattern.title}

The \widget{dashpattern.title} panel is also in the 
\widget{linestyle.title} panel. There are two radio buttons.

\widgetdef{linestyle.solid}

Select the \widget{linestyle.solid} radio button for a 
\inlineglsdef{solid-line} line.

\widgetdef{linestyle.dashed}

Select the \widget{linestyle.dashed} radio button for a
\pathattr{dash-pattern}. This will enable the \pathattr{dash-pattern}
parameters.

\widgetdef{dashpattern.dash.offset}

The \widget{dashpattern.dash.offset} is the length along the outline from the
\gls{path}['s] starting point at which the dash pattern should begin.

\widgetdef{dashpattern.dash.length}

The \widget{dashpattern.dash.length} is the length of each dash.

\widgetdef{dashpattern.dash.gap}

The \widget{dashpattern.dash.gap} is the length of the gap between
each pair of dashes.

\widgetdef{dashpattern.dash.secondary}

If the \widget{dashpattern.dash.secondary} checkbox is selected, 
a secondary dash can be specified. The dash pattern will alternate
between the primary and secondary dashes. This can be used to obtain
a dash-dot pattern.

For example, in \figureref{fig:dash} path \subfigurefmt{a} has a
solid line; path \subfigurefmt{b} has a \pathattr{dash-pattern} with
an offset of 0\gls{bp}, dash length of 10\gls{bp} and gap length of
5\gls{bp}; path \subfigurefmt{c} is the same as path
\subfigurefmt{b} except that the \pathattr{dash-pattern} has an
offset of 10\gls{bp}; path \subfigurefmt{d} has no offset, a primary
pair of dash length 10\gls{bp} and gap length 5\gls{bp}, and a
secondary pair of dash length 1\gls{bp} and gap length 5\gls{bp}
which gives a dash-dot pattern.

\FloatFig{fig:dash}
{\includeimg{dashpatterns}}
[Example Dash Patterns]
{Example dash patterns: \subfigurefmt{a}
solid line; \subfigurefmt{b} dash length 10bp and gap length 5bp;
\subfigurefmt{c} dash length 10bp, gap length 5bp and 10bp offset;
\subfigurefmt{d} primary dash length 10bp with gap length 5bp and
secondary dash length 1bp with gap length 5bp.}

\begin{information}
If you have a thick \pathattr{line-width} with a non-butt cap, the
gaps between the dashes may be obscured as the cap will be applied
to each dash. If you need a cap on either end but not on the dashes,
use a cap style start and end \pathattr{marker} instead.
\end{information}


\subsection{Cap Style}\label{sec:capstyle}

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.capstyle}

The \inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.cap-style} for a \selected\
path can either be set in the \menu{edit.path.style.capstyle} sub
menu or in the \inlineglsdef{linestyle.cap} dropdown box in the
\widget{linestyle.title} panel. The cap styles are more noticeable
with thick lines.

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.capstyle.butt}

A butt cap is flush with the start and end of the \gls{path}.

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.capstyle.round}

A round cap protrudes from the start and end of the \gls{path}.

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.capstyle.square}

A square cap protrudes from the start and end of the \gls{path}.

\FloatFig{fig:capstyles}
{\includeimg{capstyle}}
[Cap Styles]
{Cap styles: \subfigurefmt{a} butt, \subfigurefmt{b} round,
\subfigurefmt{c} square.  Note that the round and square caps protrude from
the start and end vertices.}

\begin{information}
The cap is affected by whether the \gls{path} is open or closed. In
\figureref{fig:capopena} the path is an open path where the end
points happen to coincide; in \figureref{fig:capopenb} the path is a
closed path.
\end{information}

\subsection{Join Style}\label{sec:joinstyle}

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.joinstyle}

The \menu{edit.path.style.joinstyle} menu item opens a dialog
with a \widget{linestyle.join} panel in which
you can change the \inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.join-style} 
of all \selected\ \glspl{shape}.

\widgetdef{linestyle.join}

The \widget{linestyle.join} panel is also in the 
\widget{linestyle.title} panel. Use the dropdown box to select the
\pathattr{join-style}, which may be one of:
\inlineglsdef{linestyle.join.mitre}
(for a \inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.join-style.mitre} join, see
\figureref{fig:joinstyles-mitre}),
\inlineglsdef{linestyle.join.round}
(for a \inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.join-style.round} join, see
\figureref{fig:joinstyles-round}), or
\inlineglsdef{linestyle.join.bevel}
(for a \inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.join-style.bevel} join, see
\figureref{fig:joinstyles-bevel}).

\widgetdef{linestyle.mitre_limit}

If \widget{linestyle.join.mitre} is selected, the \widget{linestyle.mitre_limit}
field will be enabled. The value must be greater than or equal to
1.0.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:joinstyles}
{
   {fig:joinstyles-mitre}{\includeimg{joinMitre}}{},

\subsection{Winding Rule}\label{sec:winding}

The \inlineglsdef{index.path-attribute.winding-rule} describes how a \gls{path} is
filled (if it has a \pathattr{fill-paint}). The
\pathattr{winding-rule} can be either
even-odd or non-zero. \figureref{fig:windingrule} illustrates the
difference between the two winding rules. A \gls*{path} was constructed
with a \gls{gap} between the outer and inner rectangles.
\figureref{fig:windingrulea} shows the effect using the even-odd
winding rule and \figureref{fig:windingruleb} shows the effect
using the non-zero winding rule. The winding rule is also used when
extracting the parameters for
\gls{parshape} (see \sectionref{sec:parshape}) and
\gls{shapepar} (see \sectionref{sec:shapepar}).

\pathattr{winding-rule}.

\seealsorefs{sec:cheeseexample}

\subsection{Markers}\label{sec:markers}

The start, mid and end \inlineglspluraldef{index.marker} are placed on
the start, intermediate points (mid-points) and end vertices, respectively. Some of the
markers require a size, some of them are dependent on the line width
and some of them require a size as well as being dependent on the
line width.

Markers can be specified by clicking on the \widget{button.choose}
button alongside the applicable \widget{linestyle.arrow.start},
\widget{linestyle.arrow.mid} or \widget{linestyle.arrow.end}
row in the \dialog{linestyle} panel (accessed with \menu{edit.path.style.all_styles}
to change the currently \selected\ shapes or with
\menu{settings.styles} to change the current marker styles to apply
to new \glspl{path}).

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.all_markers}

If you want to set the start, mid and end \glspl{index.marker} to
the same type for currently \selected\ shapes, you can use
\menu{edit.path.style.all_markers} which will open a marker dialog.
When you click on the \widget{button.okay} button, the marker type
will be applied to all the markers on the \selected\ shapes.

Alternatively, you can set the start, mid and end
\glspl{index.marker} for \selected\ shapes separately.

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.startarrow}

The \menu{edit.path.style.startarrow} will open a dialog with the
marker panel in which you can set the start \dgls{marker} for
all \selected\ shapes. Start markers are automatically reversed as
they are designed to point towards the start.

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.midarrow}

The \menu{edit.path.style.midarrow} will open a dialog with the
marker panel in which you can set the mid \dgls{marker} for
all \selected\ shapes.

\menudef{menu.edit.path.style.endarrow}

The \menu{edit.path.style.endarrow} will open a dialog with the
marker panel in which you can set the end \dgls{marker} for
all \selected\ shapes.

The marker panel used in each case has a sample panel along the top
illustrating the selected settings. Below the panel are two
checkboxes:

\widgetdef{arrow.composite}

The \widget{arrow.composite} is only available if secondary marker
is enabled. See \sectionref{sec:compositemarkers}.

\widgetdef{arrow.overlay}

The \widget{arrow.overlay} is only available if secondary marker
is enabled. See \sectionref{sec:compositemarkers}.

Below these checkboxes are the two main tabs:

\widgetdef{arrow.primary}

The \widget{arrow.primary} tab specifies the settings for the
primary marker.

\widgetdef{arrow.secondary}

The \widget{arrow.secondary} tab specifies the settings for the
primary marker. This tab is only available if the primary marker is
set and the \widget{arrow.composite} checkbox is selected.

The \widget{arrow.primary} and \widget{arrow.secondary} panels have
the same layout:
\begin{itemize}
\item Radio buttons to enable or disable the marker.
See \sectionref{sec:enablingmarkers}.

\item The marker \gls{index.marker.type} tabs (only available if the marker is
enabled). See \sectionref{sec:markertypes}.

\item The marker \gls{index.marker.size} (only available if
supported by the selected marker \gls{index.marker.type}).
See \sectionref{sec:markersize}.

\item The \gls{index.marker.repeating} radio buttons.
See \sectionref{sec:repeatingmarkers}.

\item The \widget{arrow.reversed} checkbox.
See \sectionref{sec:reversingmarkers}. 

\item The \widget{arrow.autoorient} checkbox.
See \sectionref{sec:markerorientation}.

\item The \widget{arrow.autooffset} checkbox.
See \sectionref{sec:markeroffset}.

\item The \widget{arrow.autogap} checkbox.
See \sectionref{sec:repeatgap}.

\item The \gls{index.marker.colour} setting.
See \sectionref{sec:markerpaint}.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Enabling or Disabling a Marker}\label{sec:enablingmarkers}

\widgetdef{arrow.usemarker}

To enable a marker, select the \widget{arrow.usemarker}
radio button. This will enable the applicable widgets for the
selected marker (see \sectionref{sec:markertypes}).

\widgetdef{arrow.nomarker}

To disable a marker, select the \widget{arrow.nomarker} radio
button. This will disable all the marker settings.

\subsubsection{Marker Types}\label{sec:markertypes}

Marker \inlineglspluraldef{index.marker.type}
are divided into six categories:

\widgetdef{arrow.tab.arrows}

An arrow marker looks like an arrow head or triangle or hook.
The tips may protrude forward beyond the vertex but mostly they protrude
back from the vertex.
Available arrow markers are listed in \tableref{tab:arrowmarkers}.

\widgetdef{arrow.tab.partial}

A partial marker looks like one half of an arrow marker.
Available partial markers are listed in \tableref{tab:partialmarkers}.

\widgetdef{arrow.tab.data}

Data point style markers are mostly \manmsg{centred} on the applicable
vertex (but can be shifted with an offset).
Available data point markers are listed in \tableref{tab:datapointmarkers}.

\widgetdef{arrow.tab.bracket}

Bracket style markers which protrude back from the vertex.
Available bracket markers are listed in \tableref{tab:bracketmarkers}.

\widgetdef{arrow.tab.decorative}

Decorative markers are dingbat style shapes but also include circles
and diamonds.
Available decorative markers are listed in \tableref{tab:decorativemarkers}.

\widgetdef{arrow.tab.caps}
Cap style markers protrude forward beyond the vertex.
Available cap markers are listed in \tableref{tab:capmarkers}.

\begin{important}
The cap style markers do not replace the line \pathattr{cap-style},
but are in addition to the line \pathattr{cap-style}. However the cap style
markers generally look best in combination with the
\editfn{path.style.capstyle.butt} cap line style.
\end{important}

\subsubsection{Marker Size}\label{sec:markersize}


\widgetdef{arrow.size}

The \widget{arrow.size} box will be enabled for only the
resizeable markers. This box can be used to vary the 
\inlineglsdef{index.marker.size},
but some markers also depend on the line width, so the size box is
only meant as a general guide.

\subsubsection{Repeating Markers}\label{sec:repeatingmarkers}

\Inlineglsdef{index.marker.repeating} markers are supported (up to
three markers, including the original). This is where the marker is
duplicated or triplicated, each copy slightly offset from the original marker.

\figureref{fig:repeatmarkers} illustrates single, double and triple
repeat markers for a path with a \LaTeX\ style end arrow. Note that
the markers are placed along the gradient vector which means that
they may not lie on the actual path. (See
\figureref{fig:bezierrepeat}.)

\widgetdef{arrow.single}

Select the \widget{arrow.single} radio button for a single marker.

\widgetdef{arrow.double}

Select the \widget{arrow.double} radio button for two markers.

\widgetdef{arrow.triple}

Select the \widget{arrow.triple} radio button for three markers.

[Repeat Markers Are Placed Along the Gradient Vector]
{Repeat markers are placed along the gradient vector.}


\subsubsection{Reversing Markers}\label{sec:reversingmarkers}

A marker may be \inlineglsdef{index.marker.reversed} so that it
points in the opposite direction. Note that start markers are always 
automatically reversed, so reversing a start marker would make it
point in the same direction as the mid and end marker of the same
type.

\widgetdef{arrow.reversed}

Select the \widget{arrow.reversed} check box to reverse the marker
(see \figureref{fig:reversedmarkers}).

\FloatSubFigs{fig:reversedmarkers}

}
[Reversed Markers]
{Reversed markers:
\subfigref{fig:reversedmarkersa} single reversed;
\subfigref{fig:reversedmarkersb} double reversed;
\subfigref{fig:reversedmarkersc} triple reversed.}

\subsubsection{Composite Markers}\label{sec:compositemarkers}

A \inlineglsdef{index.marker.composite} marker is formed by
combining two markers: the primary marker and a secondary marker.

\widgetdef{arrow.composite}

To combine the primary marker with another marker, select the
\widget{arrow.composite} \gls{checkbox} which will enable the
\widget{arrow.secondary} tab and the \widget{arrow.overlay} checkbox.

\widgetdef{arrow.overlay}

If the \widget{arrow.overlay} \gls*{checkbox}
is selected, the primary and secondary markers will be positioned so
that their origins coincide, otherwise the secondary marker will be
offset from the primary marker (see also the marker
\gls{index.marker.offset} in \sectionref{sec:markeroffset}). 

\figureref{fig:composite} shows two examples of composite markers:
in \figureref{fig:compositea} the start and end markers are formed
from a pointed arrow primary marker of size 5\gls{bp} and a
composite bar secondary marker, while in \figureref{fig:compositeb}
the start and end markers are formed from an open semicircle primary
marker of size 5bp with an overlaid reversed filled semicircle
secondary marker of size 5bp.

\FloatSubFigs{fig:composite}
{
 {fig:compositea}{\includeimg{composite1}}{},
 {fig:compositeb}{\includeimg{composite2}}{}
}
[Examples of Composite Markers]
{Examples of composite markers:
\subfigref{fig:compositea} a bar primary marker with a pointed secondary
marker of size 5bp;
\subfigref{fig:compositeb} an open semicircle primary marker of
size 5bp overlaid with a reversed filled semicircle secondary marker
of size 5bp.}


\subsubsection{Marker Orientation}\label{sec:markerorientation}

\widgetdef{arrow.autoorient}

If the \widget{arrow.autoorient} checkbox is selected,
the marker's \inlineglsdef{index.marker.orientation} will be
calculated to align the marker so that its $x$-axis lies along the
gradient vector at the vertex. 

If the \widget{arrow.autoorient} is not selected, the angle input
field next to it will be enabled in which you can specify the
desired angle of rotation.

\begin{important}
Remember that start markers point in the opposite direction.
\end{important}

\subsubsection{Marker Offset}\label{sec:markeroffset}

The primary marker will be placed on its origin coinciding with the
vertex. (The origin may not be on the edge of the marker's bounding
box. For example, the origin may be in the \manmsg{centre} of the
marker for most of the data point markers.)
The marker can be \inlineglsdef{index.marker.offset}
so that its origin is no longer coinciding with the vertex.

The secondary marker will be offset from the primary marker
according to whether any duplicate markers have been specified and
according to the line width.

\widgetdef{arrow.autooffset}

If the \widget{arrow.autooffset} box is selected, the marker's
\gls{index.marker.offset} from the vertex will be computed automatically. 
If this box is deselected, the marker will be offset according to
the length specified in the adjoining box, which will become
enabled.

For example, in \figureref{fig:markeroffseta} both the start and end
markers have been set to the \LaTeX\ style marker with an offset of
$-10$\gls{bp}, and in \figureref{fig:markeroffsetb} both the start
and end markers are \gls{index.marker.composite} markers formed from
a bar primary marker and a pointed secondary marker, where the
secondary marker's \gls{index.marker.offset} has been set to
2\gls{bp}.  Note that setting the secondary marker's \gls{index.marker.offset}
to 0 is equivalent to using the overlay function.

\begin{information}
Markers are placed along the \gls{path}['s] gradient
vector, so the marker may not necessarily lie on the \gls*{path}. For
example, in \figureref{fig:bezieroffset}, a marker with offset 10\gls{bp}
has been placed at the end of a \gls{Bezier-curve}. The marker's offset
has moved it along the gradient vector, away from the curve.
\end{information}

{
  {fig:markeroffseta}{\includeimg{markeroffset1}}{},
  {fig:markeroffsetb}{\includeimg{markeroffset2}}{}
}
[Disabling the Marker Auto Offset]
{Disabling the marker auto offset:
\subfigref{fig:markeroffseta} a negative offset makes the marker protrude off
the end of the line;
\subfigref{fig:markeroffsetb} the secondary marker has an offset
of 2bp so that it is only slightly behind the primary marker.}

\FloatFig{fig:bezieroffset}
{\includeimg{bezieroffset}}
[Changing a Marker's Offset Moves It Along the Gradient Vector]
{Changing a marker's offset moves it along the gradient vector.}

\subsubsection{Repeat Gap}\label{sec:repeatgap}

The \inlineglsdef{index.marker.repeat-gap} is the gap between
repeated markers.

\widgetdef{arrow.autogap}

If the \widget{arrow.autogap} box is selected, the gap
between repeat markers is given by 7 times the line width. If the
\widget{arrow.autogap} box is not selected, the gap will be given by the length specified
in the adjoining box. For example, in \figureref{fig:repeatgapa}
a line has an end marker with a triple arrow with
the auto repeat function selected. Since the line width is 1\gls{bp}, the
gap between the markers is 7\gls{bp}. In \figureref{fig:repeatgapb}
the line width is 2\gls{bp}, so the gap between the markers is 14\gls{bp}. In
\figureref{fig:repeatgapc}, the line width is 1\gls{bp} and the repeat
gap has been set to 10\gls{bp} and in \figureref{fig:repeatgapd}
the line width is 2\gls{bp} again with a repeat gap of 10\gls{bp}.

  {fig:repeatgapa}{\includeimg{repeatgap1}}{},

}

\subfigref{fig:repeatgapd} line width of 2\gls{bp} and repeat gap set to
10\gls{bp}.}


\subsubsection{Marker \Glsentrytext{manual.colour}}\label{sec:markerpaint}

The marker \inlineglsdef{index.marker.colour} may be the same as the
path or may have its own \inlineglsdef{index.marker.colour}
independent of the path's \pathattr{line-paint}.

\begin{information}
If the marker has been assigned a specific \gls{index.marker.colour}, it
will remain unchanged if you change the \pathattr{line-paint} of the
\gls*{path}, otherwise it will change with the \gls*{path}['s]
\pathattr{line-paint}.
\end{information}

\widgetdef{arrow.colour.dependent}

If the \widget{arrow.colour.dependent} box is selected, the marker will
have the same \gls{index.marker.colour} as the \gls*{path}['s]
\pathattr{line-paint}.

\widgetdef{arrow.colour.independent}

If the \widget{arrow.colour.independent} box is selected, the marker
\gls{index.marker.colour} will be independent of the \gls*{path}['s]
\pathattr{line-paint}. Selecting the \widget{arrow.colour.independent} box 
will enable the \widget{colour.single} panel where you can choose
the marker's \gls{index.marker.colour}.
For example, \figureref{fig:sampleplot} shows a \gls*{path} with
a \gls{transparent} \pathattr{line-paint} and blue start, mid and end
markers.

\FloatFig{fig:sampleplot}
{\includeimg{sampleplot}}
[Marker \Manmsg{colour} May Be Independent of the Line \Manmsg{colour}]
{Marker \manmsg{colour} may be independent of the line
\manmsg{colour}:
this path has a transparent line paint and blue
start, mid and end markers.}

Primary and secondary marker \gls{index.marker.colour} settings are
independent of each other.  For example, in
\figureref{fig:markercolour} the start and end markers are
\gls{index.marker.composite} markers formed from a filled yellow
pentagon primary marker and an open pentagon secondary marker. The
secondary marker \gls{index.marker.colour} is set to the
\pathattr{line-paint}, so if the \pathattr{line-paint} is changed
the pentagon outline will change accordingly, but the filled
pentagon will remain yellow.

\section{Text Paint}\label{sec:textpaint}

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.colour}

The \menu{edit.textarea.colour} menu item opens a dialog
with a \widget{textcolour.title} panel in which
you can change the \inlineglsdef{index.text-attribute.paint} 
of all \selected\ \glspl{textarea} and \glspl{textpath}.

\widgetdef{textcolour.title}

The \widget{textcolour.title} panel has a \dialog{colour} panel
(see \sectionref{sec:paint}) that may be used to set the 
text \textattr{paint}. This panel is also a tab
in the \dialog{styles} dialog to set the current
text \textattr{paint}.
There is a sample panel along the top illustrating the effects of
the \textattr{paint} you choose.

\begin{information}
If the text \textattr{paint} is set to \widget{colour.transparent}
then the \gls{textarea} is not painted on the canvas, but it does
have a \gls{bbox}. When \hyperref[sec:exportimage]{exporting} to a
\LaTeX\ document, \gls{transparent} \glspl*{textarea} have their
text set in the argument of \gls{phantom}.
\end{information}

\FlowframTk\ can't implement \dgls{gradient-paint} for text when
using one of the \LaTeX-related export functions. You can choose
how \FlowframTk\ should treat text with \dgls{gradient-paint} via the
\dialog{texconfig} dialog's \dialog{textconfig} panel 
(see \sectionref{sec:texconfigtext}).


\section{Text Style}\label{sec:textstyle}

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.font.all_styles}

The \menu{edit.textarea.font.all_styles} menu item opens a dialog
with a \widget{font.title} panel in which
you can change the \inlineglsdef{font} 
of all \selected\ \glspl{textarea} and \glspl{textpath}.

\widgetdef{font.title}

The \widget{font.title} panel is also a tab
in the \dialog{styles} dialog to set the current
\gls{font}. The panel has the following areas:
\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\widget{font.family}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the \textattr{font-family} (\sectionref{sec:fontfamily}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{font.size}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the \textattr{font-size} (\sectionref{sec:fontsize}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{font.series}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the \textattr{font-series} (\sectionref{sec:fontseries}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{font.shape}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Specifies the \textattr{font-shape} (\sectionref{sec:fontshape}).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\widget{font.anchor}}
\begin{itemdesc}

\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

\subsection{Font Family}\label{sec:fontfamily}

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.font.family}

The \menu{edit.textarea.font.family} menu item opens a dialog with a 
\widget{font.family} panel in which you can change the
\inlineglsdef{index.text-attribute.font-family}
of all \selected\ \glspl{textarea} and \glspl{textpath}.

\widgetdef{font.family}

The \widget{font.family} panel is also in the \widget{font.title}
panel. Use the dropdown box (\figureref{fig:setfontfamily}) to
select the font family used to \glslink{drawing-on-canvas}{draw} the
text on the \gls{canvas}.  This dropdown box provides a list of
locally available fonts found by the \gls{jre}.

\FloatFig{fig:setfontfamily}
{\includeimg{annoteFontFamily}}
{Setting the Font Family}

When you select a font family, \FlowframTk\ uses its
\inlineglsdef{font-mapping} to determine
an appropriate \LaTeX\ font family declaration.  This is used if you
\filefn{export} your image as a \LaTeX\ file (or use one of the
export functions that have \LaTeX\ as an intermediate step). If
\FlowframTk\ has guessed incorrectly, you can select a different
command from the \gls{combobox} on the right, or you can edit it if
you require a font family declaration that is not listed.
Alternatively you can clear the value (by deleting the family
declaration) to use the current document font family.

If no \gls{font-mapping} has been set, then \FlowframTk\ will guess
at the most appropriate declaration based on the font name.
If there is a particular mapping that you always
want, you can set up a \gls{font-mapping}.

The \glspl{font-mapping} are defined in a file called
\inlineglsdef{file.latexfontmap.prop} (which may need to be created, if it
doesn't exist) in \FlowframTk's \gls{config_dir}.
Each line in this file should be in the form:
\begin{compactcodebox}
\meta{font-name}=\meta{LaTeX declaration}
\end{compactcodebox}%
where \meta{font name} is the name of the font family (for example,
URW Chancery L) and \meta{LaTeX declaration} is the
code used to set the font in a \LaTeX\ document.

\begin{information}
The mapped \LaTeX\ code should be in the form of a declaration (sets
the font \qt{from this point onwards}) such as \gls{rmfamily} not a 
text block command (a command that sets its argument in the given font)
such as \gls{textrm}.
\end{information}

Blank lines or lines starting with a \gls{hash} are ignored. For
example, on my computer I have the font \qt{URW Chancery L}. If I
select this font, the \LaTeX\ equivalent will default to
\gls{rmfamily}. However, it would be more appropriate for the
\LaTeX\ declaration to select the PSNFSS chancery font. Therefore, I
can use my favourite text editor to create a file called
\file{latexfontmap.prop} with the line
\begin{compactcodebox*}
URW Chancery L=\gls{fontfamily}\marg{pzc}\gls{selectfont}
\end{compactcodebox*}%
and save it in \FlowframTk's \gls{config_dir}. Next time I
start \FlowframTk, it will load this mapping and use it whenever
I select \qt{URW Chancery L} from the font name selector.
Alternatively, you can use a regular expression. For example:
\begin{compactcodebox*}
.*[Cc]hancery.*=\gls{fontfamily}\marg{pzc}\gls{selectfont}
\end{compactcodebox*}%
This will select \code{\gls{fontfamily}\marg{pzc}\gls{selectfont}} for any font
that contains either \qt{Chancery} or \qt{chancery} in its name.
It is however faster to use the exact name.

\seealsorefs{sec:fontanchor}

\subsection{Font Size}\label{sec:fontsize}

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.font.size}

The \menu{edit.textarea.font.size} menu item opens a dialog with a 
\widget{font.size} panel in which you can change the
\inlineglsdef{index.text-attribute.font-size}
of all \selected\ \glspl{textarea} and \glspl{textpath}.

\widgetdef{font.size}

The \widget{font.size} panel is also in the \widget{font.title}
panel. Enter the desired \textattr{font-size} in the input field
(see \figureref{fig:setfontsize}).

\FloatFig{fig:setfontsize}
{\includeimg{annoteFontSize}}
{Setting the Font Size}

When you specify a font size, \FlowframTk\ guesses at the
appropriate \LaTeX\ font size declaration. The
\gls{normal-font-size} is taken from the value given in the
\widget{clssettings.title} tab (see \sectionref{sec:normalsize}) of
the \dialog{texconfig} dialog box (unless you have unchecked the
\widget{clssettings.relative_fontsize} setting). This is used if you
\filefn{export} your image as a \LaTeX\ file (or use one of the
export functions that have \LaTeX\ as an intermediate step).

If \FlowframTk\ has guessed incorrectly, you can select a different
command from the \gls{combobox} on the right, or you can edit it if
you require a font size declaration that is not listed.
Alternatively you can clear the value (by deleting the size
declaration) to use the current document font size.  Note that
\gls{veryHuge}, \gls{VeryHuge} and \gls{VERYHuge} are
not standard commands, but are defined in the \cls{a0poster}
class file.  \FlowframTk\ will only select these commands if the
normal font size is 25\gls{pt}. Remember that if you want to use
very large sizes in your \LaTeX\ document, you will need to use
scalable fonts rather than the default Computer Modern.

Note that if you change the \gls{normalsize} value (typically
through a document class option), you will
need to reselect the \textattr{font-size} for each of the \gls{textarea}['s]
that have already been defined unless the \gls*{checkbox} marked
\widget{clssettings.update} is selected in the
\widget{clssettings.title} tab of the \dialog{texconfig} dialog box.

\subsection{Font Series}\label{sec:fontseries}

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.font.series}

The \menu{edit.textarea.font.series} menu item opens a dialog with a 
\widget{font.series} panel in which you can change the
\inlineglsdef{index.text-attribute.font-series}
of all \selected\ \glspl{textarea} and \glspl{textpath}.

\widgetdef{font.series}

The \widget{font.series} panel is also in the \widget{font.title}
panel. Use the dropdown box (\figureref{fig:setfontseries}) to
select the font series used to \glslink{drawing-on-canvas}{draw} the
text on the \gls{canvas}.
The available choices are:

\widgetdef{font.series.medium}

The \widget{font.series.medium} item indicates medium weight and
will automatically set the \LaTeX\ alternative to \gls{mdseries}.

\widgetdef{font.series.bold}

The \widget{font.series.bold} item indicates bold weight and
will automatically set the \LaTeX\ alternative to \gls{bfseries}.

\FloatFig{fig:setfontseries}
{\includeimg{annoteFontSeries}}
{Setting the Font Series}

If you prefer a different \LaTeX\ declaration to the one selected,
you can select another command from the \gls{combobox} on the right
or you can edit it if you require a font series declaration that is
not listed.  Alternatively you can clear the value (by deleting the
series declaration) to use the current document font series.

\subsection{Font Shape}\label{sec:fontshape}

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.font.shape}

The \menu{edit.textarea.font.shape} menu item opens a dialog with a

The available choices are:

\widgetdef{font.shape.upright}

The \widget{font.shape.upright} item indicates upright and
will automatically set the \LaTeX\ alternative to \gls{upshape}.

\widgetdef{font.shape.italic}

The \widget{font.shape.italic} item indicates italic and
will automatically set the \LaTeX\ alternative to \gls{em}.

{Setting the Font Shape}

If you prefer a different \LaTeX\ declaration to the one selected,
you can select another command from the \gls{combobox} on the right
or you can edit it if you require a font shape declaration that is
not listed.  Alternatively you can clear the value (by deleting the
shape declaration) to use the current document font shape.

\subsection{Anchor}\label{sec:fontanchor}

There are two \inlineglspluraldef{index.text-attribute.anchor}
that relate to \glspl{textarea} and \glspl{textpath}: the horizontal
\textattr{anchor} and the vertical \textattr{anchor}.

The default is \gls{font.anchor.left} for the horizontal anchor and
\gls{font.anchor.base} for the vertical anchor. These can be changed
using the \menu{edit.textarea.font.anchor} menu. The sample panel will
display a small red dot to indicate the position of the anchor. If
you enable the \widget{textconfig.anchor} setting
(\sectionref{sec:texconfigtext}), the anchor will be changed when
you \hyperref[sec:alignobjects]{align} groups containing \glspl{textarea}.

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.font.anchor}

The \menu{edit.textarea.font.anchor} sub menu may be used to set the
\textattrpl{anchor}.

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.font.anchor.both}

The \menu{edit.textarea.font.anchor.both} menu item opens a dialog
with the \widget{font.anchor} panel to change both the horizontal
and vertical anchors for all \selected\ \glspl{textarea} and
\glspl{textpath}.

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.font.anchor.horizontal}

The \menu{edit.textarea.font.anchor.horizontal} menu opens a dialog
with the \widget{font.hanchor} component which may be used to set the
horizontal \textattr{anchor}.

\menudef{menu.edit.textarea.font.anchor.vertical}

The \menu{edit.textarea.font.anchor.vertical} menu opens a dialog
with the \widget{font.vanchor} component which may be used to set the
vertical \textattr{anchor}.

\widgetdef{font.anchor}

The \widget{font.anchor} panel is also in the \widget{font.title}
panel and provides a way to set both the horizontal and vertical
anchor at the same time. 

\widgetdef{font.hanchor}

The horizontal anchor options are:

\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\inlineglsdef{font.anchor.left}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Left horizontal anchor (corresponds to PGF node \code{west} anchor).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\inlineglsdef{font.anchor.hcentre}}
\begin{itemdesc}
\Manmsg{centre} horizontal anchor.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\inlineglsdef{font.anchor.right}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Right horizontal anchor (corresponds to PGF node \code{east} anchor).
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

\widgetdef{font.vanchor}

The vertical anchor options are:

\begin{deflist}
\itemtitle{\inlineglsdef{font.anchor.base}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Base vertical anchor (align on the baseline).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\inlineglsdef{font.anchor.vcentre}}
\begin{itemdesc}
\Manmsg{centre} vertical anchor.
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\inlineglsdef{font.anchor.top}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Top horizontal anchor (corresponds to PGF node \code{north} anchor).
\end{itemdesc}

\itemtitle{\inlineglsdef{font.anchor.bottom}}
\begin{itemdesc}
Bottom horizontal anchor (corresponds to PGF node \code{south} anchor).
\end{itemdesc}

\end{deflist}

When exporting to PGF (see \sectionref{sec:exportpgf}), each
\gls{textarea} is placed inside a node. In this case, the
\textattrpl{anchor} are used to identify the PGF node anchors.
The \gls{textarea} anchors are not used when \gls{drawing-on-canvas}
the text on the \gls{canvas}.

For a \gls{textpath}, the anchor is used to determine where the text
should be positioned along the underlying path. Changing the anchor
for a \gls*{textpath} will change the way it is displayed in
\FlowframTk\ (as illustrated in \figureref{fig:textpath}).  The
vertical anchor for \glspl*{textpath} is not supported when
exporting to a \LaTeX\ file.

If you export your image to a \LaTeX\ file, the font used in the
document is unlikely to completely match the font used in \FlowframTk.
As a result, text may appear wider or narrower in the resulting
\LaTeX\ document than in the image displayed in \FlowframTk.  This may
result in the text appearing as though it has shifted position.
(Particularly when the \gls{textarea} contains \LaTeX\ commands.) To
reduce this effect, you can specify what part of the text should be
considered as the \textattr{anchor}. To illustrate
this, consider the image shown in \figureref{fig:anchor}.  An image
was created in \FlowframTk\ containing some text bordered by a
rectangle with an additional line along the \gls*{textarea}['s]
baseline: \figureref{fig:anchora} shows how the image appears
in \FlowframTk. The font used is the generic serif font and the
text takes up the entire box. The image was then exported to a
\LaTeX\ file with various anchor settings. The \LaTeX\ document set
the Roman font via:
\begin{compactcodebox}
\csfmt{usepackage}\marg{mathptmx}
\end{compactcodebox}

This is a slightly narrower font than the font used in \FlowframTk,
so the text no longer fills the box. In \figureref{fig:anchorb}, the
anchor was set to (\gls{font.anchor.left}, \gls{font.anchor.base});
in \figureref{fig:anchorc}, the anchor was set to
(\gls{font.anchor.hcentre}, \gls{font.anchor.base}); in
\figureref{fig:anchord}, the anchor was set to
(\gls{font.anchor.right}, \gls{font.anchor.base}).  Notice that the
baseline for the text remains as it was in \FlowframTk, but the
horizontal placement of the text varies.

In this example, the height of the text in the \LaTeX\ document is
only slightly smaller than that of the font used by \FlowframTk, so
the vertical anchor setting does not make that much difference, but
there is still a slight shift: in \figureref{fig:anchore}, the
anchor was set to (\gls{font.anchor.left},
\gls{font.anchor.bottom}); in \figureref{fig:anchorf}, the anchor
was set to (\gls{font.anchor.left}, \gls{font.anchor.vcentre}); in
\figureref{fig:anchorg}, the anchor was set to
(\gls{font.anchor.left}, \gls{font.anchor.top}).

}
[The Effect of Converting from Java Fonts to \TeX\ Fonts]
{The effect of converting from system fonts to \TeX\ fonts:
\subfigref{fig:anchora} image in \FlowframTk\ using the generic serif font. The
image was then exported to a \LaTeX\ document with the anchor
set to:

\subfigref{fig:anchorc} \gls{font.anchor.hcentre}, \gls{font.anchor.base};

\subfigref{fig:anchorg} \gls{font.anchor.left}, \gls{font.anchor.top}.}

Note that in the above example, the \LaTeX\ document used a
scalable font (via the \sty{mathptmx} package). The default
Computer Modern font is not scalable. It is therefore possible that
the required size is not available, in which case \TeX\ will
substitute the closest available font size. For example, in
\figureref{fig:fontdiff}, the image created in the previous
example is again illustrated with anchor at (left, base).
\figureref{fig:fontdiffa} shows the original image in
\FlowframTk\ using the generic serif font;
\figureref{fig:fontdiffb} shows the image exported to a \LaTeX\
document that uses the \sty{mathptmx} package;
\figureref{fig:fontdiffc} shows the image exported to a
\LaTeX\ document that uses the default Computer Modern font. The
large font size (40) is not available in the Computer Modern
font, so the closest available font size is used instead, which in
this example has resulted in a significant change in size.

As mentioned earlier, if a \gls{textarea} contains \LaTeX\ commands,
this may also result in a horizontal or vertical shift. Consider an
image that contains some maths. \figureref{fig:anchorfracexa}
shows the image as it appears in \FlowframTk. The red line path is
aligned along the left edge and along the baseline of the text.  The
\gls*{textarea} has been assigned the following alternative text to be
used when exporting to a \LaTeX\ file:
\begin{verbatim}
$f(x) = \frac{(x-a_1)^2}{a_2}$
\end{verbatim}
\figureref{fig:anchorfracexb} shows how the image appears
in a \LaTeX\ document when the anchor is set to

\begin{warning}
Note that this difference in font size between the image

exporting to an encapsulated \LaTeX\ document can cause the text to
be clipped. (This also applies to the \filefn{export} functions that use the
export to encapsulated \LaTeX\ document function as an intermediate
step, such as the export to PDF function.)
\end{warning}

If the \gls*{textarea} is transformed then the anchor will
have the same transformation. See, for example,
\figureref{fig:anchortrans}.

\chapter{\TeX/\LaTeX}\label{sec:tex}

\menudef{menu.tex}

This chapter covers functions that are specific to \TeX\ or \LaTeX\
users.  These functions can be obtained via the
\menu{tex} menu. The only functions that are relevant to
Plain \TeX\ users are those relating to \gls{parshape}
and \gls{shapepar}\slash\gls{Shapepar}. The \sty{flowfram} package is a \LaTeX\
package. Although the \sty{pgf} package is available for
\TeX\ formats other than \LaTeX, \FlowframTk\ currently only exports
images using \LaTeX\ syntax.

\section{Adding Commands to the Preamble}\label{sec:preamble}

The \hyperref[sec:exportdoc]{export to single-paged document}
functions create a complete \LaTeX\ document, including the document
class and \inlineglsdef{preamble}.  The generated \ext{tex} file has the form:
\begin{compactcodebox}
\cmd{documentclass}\oargm{cls size opt}\margm{class-name}
\strut
\cmd{usepackage}\marg{ifpdf}

\meta{Default Preamble}

\cmd{usepackage}\marg{pgf}
\cmd{usepgflibrary}\marg{decorations.text}

\meta{Early-Preamble}

\meta{Definition of \gls+{jdroutline}}

\cmd{usepackage}\oargm{options}\marg{geometry}

\meta{Mid-Preamble}

\cmd{pagestyle}\marg{empty}

\meta{Definition of \gls+{jdrimagebox}}

\meta{Late-Preamble}

\cmd{begin}\marg{document}\cmd{noindent}
\cmd{jdrimagebox}\margm{image code}
\cmd{end}\marg{document}
\end{compactcodebox}

The document class \meta{class-name} and base font size
\meta{cls size opt} are obtained from the
\widget{clssettings.title} tab of the
\dialog{texconfig} dialog (see \sectionref{sec:normalsize}).

As shown above, the \sty{pgf}, \sty{geometry} and
\sty{ifpdf} packages are automatically added to the \gls{preamble},
and the \sty*{pgf} \sty{decorations.text} library is also
loaded, in case the image contains any \glspl{textpath}.
\FlowframTk\ also defines the command:
\cmddef{jdroutline}
This is used for any outline \glspl{textarea} (but not
\glspl{textpath}, as outline \glspl*{textpath} are not supported by
the \LaTeX-related export functions.)

The other command that's automatically defined in the \gls{preamble} is:
\cmddef{jdrimagebox}
This is used in case the image turns out to be slightly larger than
calculated. (This could be caused by rounding errors, or the
difference in fonts, as discussed in \sectionref{sec:fontanchor}.)
The \env{pgfpicture} environment is placed inside the argument of
\gls{jdrimagebox} to prevent spurious blank pages occurring.

\begin{information}
If you \hyperref[sec:exportpgf]{export} to a file containing \sty{pgf}
code to be input by another document, you will need to inspect the 
created \ext{tex} file for information regarding required files and
command definitions.
\end{information}

In addition \gls{pdfinfo} is added with the creation date and
optionally a title if the \widget{clssettings.pdfinfo} option
is selected in the \dialog{texconfig} dialog.
(The title is obtained from the image description, see
\sectionref{sec:imagedescription}.) The relevant code is placed
after the early-preamble code and before the definition of
\gls{jdroutline}. The conditional \gls{ifpdf} is used so
that \gls{pdfinfo} is only used with \pdfLaTeX.

The \gls{preamble.default} code (\meta{Default Preamble}) is set using the
\widget{preambleconfig.title} tab of the \dialog{texconfig} dialog
box (see \sectionref{sec:texconfigpreamble}). This is general code
that applies to all images that are exported to a LaTeX document.

\begin{information}
Note that the \gls{preamble.default} isn't used by the export to package
or class functions.
\end{information}

The \gls{preamble.early} (\meta{Early-Preamble}), 
\gls{preamble.mid} (\meta{Mid-Preamble}) and \gls{preamble.late}
(\meta{Late-Preamble}) code is assigned to a specific image, and can
be used to add any additional \gls{preamble} code required for that image.
For example, if any of the \glspl{textarea} have alternative text
that contains a command that isn't part of the \LaTeX\ kernel, the
\gls{preamble.early} can include the code to load the package that defines
the command or the \glsname{preamble.mid} or \gls{preamble.late} can include the command
definition.

\menudef{menu.tex.set_preamble}

The \glsname{preamble.early}, \glsname{preamble.mid} and
\gls{preamble.late} code can be edited in the
\gls{preamble} panel attached to the side of the
\gls{canvas} (see \figureref{fig:preambleeditor}). There is a
divider between these two areas that can be moved to adjust the
visible size of each area, allowing one area to take up more or less
room than the other. You can also use the \menu{tex.set_preamble}
menu item to open the preamble panel to its preferred width.

\FloatFig{fig:preambleeditor}
{\includeimg{annotePreamble}}
{The Preamble Panel}

For some \hyperref[sec:lookandfeel]{look and feels}, the
divider has small icons that you can click on to move the divider
part way across the child window or click again to move it all the
way across so that one of the panels is no longer visible. However,
for some look and feels, it's not possible to completely hide the
preamble panel.

\widgetdef{texeditor.preamble}

The \widget{texeditor.preamble} panel has three tabbed panels.
Each panel has the same layout with a horizontal toolbar and an
editor area below it in which you can type the code. 

The editor area has syntax highlighting. You can change the
\manmsgpl{colour} used or switch off the highlighting using the
\dialog{texeditorui} dialog (\sectionref{sec:texeditorui}).

\widgetdef{texeditor.preamble.early}

The \widget{texeditor.preamble.early} panel is for the 
\inlineglstextdef{preamble.early}, which is typically for package
loading. If the \glspl{textarea-mapping} are enabled (see
\sectionref{sec:texconfigtext}), any
required packages for mapped symbols will automatically be
added to the \gls{preamble.early}.

If you use the \hyperref[sec:exportsty]{export to package or document
class} functions, the \gls{preamble.early} code will be
inserted before the option declarations, which allows you to add
extra options, if required.

\widgetdef{texeditor.preamble.mid}

The \widget{texeditor.preamble.mid} panel is for the
\inlineglstextdef{preamble.mid}, which may be used to define
commands for use in any \gls{textarea}['s] alternative \LaTeX\ text.

If you use the \hyperref[sec:exportsty]{export to package or document
class} functions, the \gls{preamble.mid} code will be inserted after
the underlying class or package has been loaded.

\widgetdef{texeditor.preamble.late}

The \widget{texeditor.preamble.late} panel is for the
\inlineglstextdef{preamble.late}, which may also be used to define
commands for use in any \gls{textarea}['s] alternative \LaTeX\ text.

If you use the \hyperref[sec:exportsty]{export to package or document
class} functions, the \gls{preamble.late} code will be inserted 
at the end of the file, just before
\gls{endinput}. Any instances of \gls{usepackage} found in
the preamble code will be replaced by \gls{RequirePackage}
during the export.

The \widget{texeditor.preamble.late} panel is shown in \figureref{fig:preambleeditor2},
where a command has been defined:
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand*{\bvec}[1]{\boldsymbol{#1}}
\end{verbatim}
This command has been used in the alternative text for one of the
\glspl{textarea} on the \gls{canvas}. The dialog box showing this
alternative text is also visible.

\FloatFig
  {fig:preambleeditor2}
  {\includeimg{preambleeditor2}}
  {The Late-Preamble Tab}

The image's \glsname{preamble.early}, \glsname{preamble.mid} and
\gls{preamble.late} code is stored in \gls{JDR}\slash \gls{AJR}
files, but not for versions less than 1.9, so make sure you use the
latest file version when you save your image. (This is done
automatically if you use \menu{file.save}.) \gls{JDR}\slash\gls{AJR}
version 1.8, introduced in \FlowframTk\ version 0.7, only stores the
\gls{preamble.early} code.  \FlowframTk\ version 0.8
(\gls{JDR}\slash\gls{AJR} v1.9) introduced \gls{preamble.mid} and
late-preamble panels. The original preamble panel (which was
previously just in a dialog window) is now referred to as the
\gls{preamble.early}.

\section{\TeX\ Editor}\label{sec:texeditor}

The \TeX\ editor is used for the \widget{texeditor.preamble} panels,
the \dialog{preambleconfig} dialog (\sectionref{sec:texconfigpreamble}),
and for the static and dynamic frame contents dialog.

\menudef{index.menu.texeditor}

The \gls{index.menu.texeditor} \gls*{popupmenu} can be activated with a \gls{menuclick}.
Alternatively, you can use the \accelerator{popup} key or, if supported by your
system, the \accelerator{context_menu} \gls{context-menu} key.
The buttons on the toolbar may be used instead of the popup menu.

\menudef{menu.texeditor.undo}%
The \menu{texeditor.undo} function undoes the last edit. Note that
this is separate to the \menu{edit.undo} menu item for edits to the
image on the \gls{canvas}. Each panel has its own independent
undo\slash redo manager.

\menudef{menu.texeditor.redo}%
The \menu{texeditor.redo} function redoes the last undone edit. Note that
this is separate to the \menu{edit.redo} menu item for edits to the
image on the \gls{canvas}.

\menudef{menu.texeditor.selectAllText}%
The \menu{texeditor.selectAllText} function selects all the text in
preamble panel that has the focus.

\menudef{menu.texeditor.cutText}%
The \menu{texeditor.cutText} function cuts the selected text in the
preamble panel that has the focus to the clipboard.

\menudef{menu.texeditor.copyText}%
The \menu{texeditor.copyText} function copies the selected text in the
preamble panel that has the focus to the clipboard.

\menudef{menu.texeditor.pasteText}%
The \menu{texeditor.pasteText} function pastes text from the
clipboard into the preamble panel that has the focus.

\menudef{menu.texeditor.find}%
The \menu{texeditor.find} function opens the \dialog{find}
dialog.

\widgetdef{find.title}%
The \dialog{find} dialog has a text field where you can enter your
search term. 

\widgetdef{find.case}%
Select the \widget{find.case} checkbox for a case-sensitive search.

\widgetdef{find.regex}%
Select the \widget{find.regex} checkbox if the search term is a
regular expression.

\widgetdef{find.wrap}%
Select the \widget{find.wrap} checkbox to wrap round to the start.

\widgetdef{find.find}%
The \widget{find.find} button will find the first occurrence of the
search term from the position of the cursor.

\menudef{menu.texeditor.find_again}%
The \menu{texeditor.find_again} function finds the previous
search term.

\menudef{menu.texeditor.replace}%
The \menu{texeditor.replace} function opens the
\dialog{replace} dialog.

\widgetdef{replace.title}%
The \dialog{replace} dialog has the same buttons as the
\dialog{find} dialog but also has a text field where you can enter
the replacement text.

\widgetdef{replace.replace}%
The \widget{replace.replace} button will replace the found text.

\widgetdef{replace.replace_all}%
The \widget{replace.replace_all} button will replace all occurrences.

\section{Computing the Parameters for \glsfmttext{parshape}}\label{sec:parshape}

\menudef{menu.tex.parshape}

\TeX's \gls{parshape} command can be used to change a
standard rectangular shaped paragraph into a non-rectangular
shape. The syntax is:
\cmddef{parshape}
where \meta{i\textsubscript{1}} is the indent for
the first line and \meta{l\textsubscript{1}} is
the length of the first line, etc.  This command should be placed at
the start of the paragraph, and is only applied to that paragraph.
If there are more than \meta{n} lines in the
paragraph, the specification for the \meta{n}th
line will be used until the end of the paragraph. If there are less
than \meta{n} lines in the paragraph, the shape
will be truncated. See \emph{The \TeX{}book}~\cite{Knuth} for further
details.

Since each line in the paragraph is constructed from only indent and
line width information, only certain types of shapes can be
specified by a \gls{parshape}. If you imagine horizontal
scan lines passing \manmsg{through} the shape, each scan line should not
be able to intersect the boundary of the shape more than twice.

Before you use \FlowframTk\ to determine the parameters for
\gls{parshape}, you must first ensure that you have set the
\gls{normal-font-size} (\sectionref{sec:normalsize}) to the value
used in your document. See, for example, \figureref{fig:news26} (in
\sectionref{sec:newstutorial}) which illustrates what happens when
you fail to do this.

\widgetdef{parshape.title}

To determine the parameters for a \gls{parshape}, create your shape
as a single \gls{path}. Select this \gls*{path}, and use the menu
item \menu{tex.parshape}.  This will open up the \dialog{parshape} dialog box.

\widgetdef{parshape.use_path}

Select the \widget{parshape.use_path} radio button if you want to
use the outline defined by the action \gls{path}.

\widgetdef{parshape.use_outline}

Select the \widget{parshape.use_outline} radio button if you want to
use the outline defined by the line style (stroked path).

For example, \figureref{fig:parshapeex1a} shows a \gls*{path}
which consists of a single line segment (shown in
\figureref{fig:parshapeex1b}), but with a
\pathattr{line-width} of 52\gls{bp}, butt
\pathattr{cap-style} and an equilateral triangle
start \pathattr{marker} of size 80bp.  If you
select the \widget{parshape.use_path} option, \FlowframTk\
will attempt to construct the parameters from the actual \gls*{path}
(ignoring the line style) which it will not be able to do, as the
\gls*{path} has no area. If you select the
\widget{parshape.use_outline} option, \FlowframTk\ will
construct the parameters from the outline as seen on the screen.
These parameters can be saved to a file, and used in a \TeX\ or
\LaTeX\ document to create a shaped paragraph
(\figureref{fig:parshapeex1c}).

\subfigref{fig:parshapeex1c}
\gls{parshape} parameters constructed from the outline
\subfigref{fig:parshapeex1a} used to create an arrow shaped paragraph in a \LaTeX\
document.}

Another example is shown in \figureref{fig:parshapeex2}. In this
example, the \gls*{path} was constructed using the ellipse tool. If you
select the \widget{parshape.use_path} option, \FlowframTk\ will compute the
parameters used to create the paragraph shown in
\figureref{fig:parshapeex2b}. In this example, you will not be
able to use the \widget{parshape.use_outline} option as this will attempt to
create an annulus defined by the \gls*{path}['s] border, which can't be
done by \gls{parshape} (but can be done by \gls{shapepar},
although it is not recommended for such a narrow line width).

\FloatSubFigs{fig:parshapeex2}[\small]

 {fig:parshapeex2b}{\includeimg{parshapeex2b}}{}
}
[Parshape (Using Path)]
{Parshape \widget{parshape.use_path}:
\subfigref{fig:parshapeex2a} the path;
\subfigref{fig:parshapeex2b} \gls{parshape} parameters constructed from the 
path \subfigref{fig:parshapeex2a}
used to create an elliptical shaped paragraph in a \LaTeX\ document.}

Whilst the parameters are being computed, the horizontal
scan lines used by \FlowframTk\ will appear on screen, and if
successful, a dialog box will appear for you to save the
\gls{parshape} command to a file. You can then input this
file at the start of the appropriate paragraph in your \TeX\ or
\LaTeX\ document. For example, if you save the \gls{parshape}
command to a file called, say, \filefmt{myparshape.tex}, then if
you are using plain \TeX\ you would need to do:
\begin{verbatim}
\input myparshape
This is the start of the paragraph...
\end{verbatim}
or if you are using \LaTeX\ you would need to do:
\begin{verbatim}
\input{myparshape}%
This is the start of the paragraph...
\end{verbatim}
You may want to suppress the paragraph indentation using
\gls{noindent}:
\begin{verbatim}
\input{myparshape}%
\noindent This is the start of the paragraph...
\end{verbatim}

The distance between the scanlines is given by the
value of \gls{baselineskip} for the \gls{normal-font-size}.
For example, if the normal font size is 10\gls{pt}, \gls{baselineskip}
will be 12pt, and this will be the distance used between
the scanlines. It is therefore important that you set the value
for the \gls{normal-font-size} before using this function.

\section{Computing the Parameters for \glsfmttext{shapepar} or
\glsfmttext{Shapepar}}
\label{sec:shapepar}

\menudef{menu.tex.shapepar}

The \gls{parshape} command is fairly limited. You need the right
amount of text in the paragraph to get the shape right, and you
can't have cut out sections. These two things can be overcome using
the \inlineglsdef{shapepar} or \inlineglsdef{Shapepar} commands
defined in the \sty{shapepar} package. The syntax for these commands
is complex and those interested should read the \sty{shapepar}
documentation. As with \gls{parshape}, the shape is constructed
using horizontal scan lines. If you want gaps to appear in your
shape, make sure to set the \pathattr{winding-rule}
(\sectionref{sec:winding}) to even-odd.  If in doubt, give the
\gls{path} a \pathattr{fill-paint}; the area that is filled will
contain the text of the paragraph, and the area that isn't filled
won't.

\begin{information}
\FlowframTk\ defaults to using \gls{Shapepar} rather than
\gls{shapepar}, but you can change this in the
\dialog{texconfig} dialog (\sectionref{sec:texconfig}).
\end{information}

To determine the parameters for \gls{Shapepar}\slash\gls{shapepar}, create
your shape as a single \gls*{path}. Select this \gls*{path}, and use
the \menu{tex.shapepar} menu item, which will open the
\dialog{shapepar} dialog.

\widgetdef{shapepar.title}

The \dialog{shapepar} dialog has the same \widget{parshape.use_path}
and \widget{parshape.use_outline} radio buttons as the
\dialog{parshape} dialog, which allow you to select
whether you want to use the \gls*{path} itself to define the shape
or whether you want to use the \gls*{path}['s] outline to define the shape.
For example, \figureref{fig:shapeparexa} shows a \gls*{path} with a
40bp line width. The \gls{shapepar} parameters were constructed
first from the \gls*{path} (\figureref{fig:shapeparexb}) and then from
the outline (\figureref{fig:shapeparexc}).

\FloatSubFigs*{fig:shapeparex}[\small]
{
  {fig:shapeparexa}{\includeimg{shapeparexa}}{},
  {fig:shapeparexb}{\includeimg{shapeparexb}}{},
  {fig:shapeparexc}{\includeimg{shapeparexc}}{}
}
[Shapepar Example]
{Shapepar example:
\subfigref{fig:shapeparexa} the path;
\subfigref{fig:shapeparexb} parameters constructed from the path and included in a
\LaTeX\ document to produce a shaped paragraph;
\subfigref{fig:shapeparexc}
parameters constructed from the path's outline and included in a
\LaTeX\ document to produce a shaped paragraph.}

As with the parshape function, the horizontal
scan lines used by \FlowframTk\ will appear on screen, and if
successful, a dialog box will appear for you to save the
\gls{Shapepar}\slash\gls{shapepar} command to a file. You can then input this
file at the start of the appropriate paragraph in your \TeX\ or
\LaTeX\ document. For example, if you save the
command to a file called, say, \filefmt{myshapepar.tex}, then if
you are using plain \TeX\ you would need to do:
\begin{verbatim}
\input myshapepar
This is the start of the paragraph...
\end{verbatim}
or if you are using \LaTeX\ you would need to do:
\begin{verbatim}
\input{myshapepar}%
This is the start of the paragraph...
\end{verbatim}
Remember to include the \sty{shapepar} package:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|\input shapepar.sty| (plain \TeX)
\item \verb|\usepackage{shapepar}| (\LaTeX)
\end{itemize}

\section{Creating Frames for Use with the \stytext{flowfram} Package}
\label{sec:flowframe}

\pkgdef{flowfram}

\FlowframTk\ can be used to help construct frames for use with the
\sty{flowfram} package. If you are unfamiliar with this
package, please ensure that you read the user manual.
\texdocref{flowfram}

\subsection{The \stytext{flowfram} Package: A Brief Summary}
\label{sec:flowframesummary}

The \sty{flowfram} package is a \LaTeX\ package that allows
the user to construct frames in a document, such that the document
text flows from one frame to the next in the order that the
frames were defined. The mechanism is much the same as that used
to create the columns when using the standard two column mode, but
the columns are of arbitrary width, height and position.

Imagine that you have a number of rectangular sheets of transparent
paper. You start writing on the first sheet until it's filled, then
you put it aside and start writing on the next until that one's
filled as well, and so on. When you've filled all the sheets, pick
up the first one and glue it onto your page in your desired
location, then pick up the next one and glue that onto the page, and
so on. If you've glued one sheet down so that it overlaps another,
the text on the top sheet will obscure the text on the lower sheet.

There are three types of frame defined by the \sty{flowfram}
package: \qt{flow} frames
which are the main type of frame. These are the frames in which the
document text is placed and they are analogous to the transparent
sheets of paper example described above. The other two types of frame are
called \qt{static} and \qt{dynamic}.  The contents of these frames has
to be set explicitly using one of the commands or environments
provided by the \sty{flowfram} package.

The contents of the static frames are typeset once (when the
contents are set) and it remains unchanged until the user explicitly
resets the contents. (Static frames have an associated box defined
via \csfmt{newbox} in which the contents are stored.) The contents
of the dynamic frames are re-typeset on each page for which the
frame is defined. (The contents are stored in a macro rather than in
a box.)

So, for example, if on page~1 of your document, you set the contents
of a static frame to contain the command \gls{thepage}, the
contents of that frame will always display a~1 (no matter what page
it appears on), since that was the value of \gls{thepage} when
the contents were set. If, on the other hand, you use a dynamic
frame, the contents will be re-typeset on every page, so it will
display the relevant page number.

Each frame has an associated label which uniquely identifies it for
a given frame type, and the frame can optionally have a border. Frames also
have an associated page list indicating on which pages the frame
should appear.  The page list can be one of the keywords
\optfmt{all}, \optfmt{odd}, \optfmt{even} or \optfmt{none}, or it
can be a comma separated list of pages or page ranges (e.g.\
\verb|<4,7,9,10-14,>20|). By default, the \sty{flowfram} package
assumes these numbers refer to the decimal value of the
\ctr{page} counter (so 9 means the frame is visible on page 9, on
page ix, on page IX, or even on page nine, if you've redefined
\gls{thepage} to use a number string). The \sty{flowfram}
package provides the option \optval{pages}{absolute}, which indicates
that the page lists refer to the absolute page number rather than
the value of the \ctr{page} counter. So if your document pages
are numbered, say, 1, i, ii, iii, 1, 2, 3, then the absolute page 3
is the page numbered ii, since it's the third page of the document.

The \sty{flowfram} package stacks the frames on the page in
the following order: static, flow and dynamic, each in the order
in which they were defined. For example, if you define a flow frame
called \optfmt{left}, then define a static frame called
\optfmt{title}, then a dynamic frame called \optfmt{header}
and lastly a flow frame defined \optfmt{right}, then the
\sty{flowfram} package will stack the frames in the following
order: \optfmt{title}, \optfmt{left}, \optfmt{right} and
\optfmt{header}. This means that the static frames can be used for
background effects.

When exporting to a package or class file (\sectionref{sec:exportsty}),
\FlowframTk\ will define the frames according to its own
\gls{stackingorder}. However, it will allow you to position, say, a
static frame above a flow frame when displayed on the \gls{canvas}.
The object with the static frame data may obscure the other object
when viewed in \FlowframTk, but it will appear in the background
when displayed in the document.
