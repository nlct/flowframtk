The latest release can be obtained from [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/flowframtk).

Under construction (in the process of moving over from a local
non-git repository and changing structure).

FlowframTk is a vector graphics application written in Java. You can use FlowframTk to:

 - Construct shapes using lines, moves and cubic BÃ©zier segments.
 - Edit shapes by changing the defining control points.
 - Add symmetry to shapes.
 - Convert shapes into rotational, scaled or spiral patterns
 - Incorporate text and bitmap images (for annotation and background effects).
 - Display text along a shape.
 - Extract the parameters for TeX's `\parshape` command and for [`\shapepar`](https://ctan.org/pkg/shapepar).
 - Construct frames for use with the [`flowfram`](https://ctan.org/pkg/flowfram) package and export as a class or package.
 - Pictures can be saved in FlowframTk's native open binary format or native open ascii format or can be exported as:
   + a pgfpicture environment for use in LaTeX documents with the pgf package;
   + a complete single-paged LaTeX document that contains the pgf image code;
   + a LaTeX package or class based on the flowfram package;
   + a PNG image file;
   + a PostScript file;
   + a PDF image file;
   + a scalable vector graphics (SVG) image file.
   (Export functions for PS, PDF and SVG all require a TeX distribution.) 
 - Alternative text can be specified to use when exporting to a LaTeX file.
 - Mappings can be used to specify what LaTeX font declarations should be used when exporting to a LaTeX file.
 - Accompanying Applications: 
   + `jdrview`: A lightweight jdr/ajr image viewer
   + `jdrutils`: A suite of command line converters

##Source Code

To build from the source code you will need to add `javahelp2.jar`
to the `lib` directory. For example:

```bash
cd src/lib
ln -s /usr/share/java/javahelp2.jar
```

The JavaHelp files are created from the XML file in the
`src/doc/manual` directory by the `createflowframtkdocs` Perl
script. This also creates the LaTeX source for the PDF manual
(with `arara` directives at the start). Locale-specific text is
obtained from the corresponding property file
`src/lib/resources/dictionaries`. For example:
```bash
createflowframtkdocs FlowframTk en GB
```
This fetches the application version details from 
`FlowframTkInvoker.java`, the locale text from 
`flowframtk-en-GB.prop`, and the locale-sensitive images from
`images-en-GB`. (Non-locale images are in `shared-images`.) 
The helpset files are written to
`src/lib/resources/helpsets/flowframtk/en-GB` and the LaTeX
file `flowframtk-en-GB.tex` is written in the `src/doc/manual`
directory. The PDF can be then be created with:
```bash
arara flowframtk-en-GB
```
The `createflowframtkdocs` Perl script was developed on Linux.
There's no guarantee that it will work with other platforms.
